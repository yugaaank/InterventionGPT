in order to treat the occurrence of crashes, crash data is needed to provide necessary information to road the primary data source for crash reduction initiatives, especially those undertaken by road engineers, is include the crash severity and the number of each injury severity type (i.e. fatal, serious, minor, etc.). high risk locations are often located at nodes of the road network, i.e. at crossing points between two or
point, such as between crashes that occur at or because of an intersection and crashes that are considered case the information is of little use. link lengths ranging from 500 m to 1,000 m are usually adequate for successive sections of equal length. however, it can prevent the detection of crash concentrations located at the boundary of two adjacent sections. the use of mobile sections that shift a constant section length,

28 faded road marking broken traffic lane line marking the carriageway having two or more in one direction are divided into separate lanes by traffic lane line marking for vehicles to move in proper lanes and to discourage the meandering tendency of the drivers, thereby promoting safety and ensuring maximum capacity. traffic lane markings should be applied near pedestrian crossings, hazardous locations, congested areas, and important one-way streets, ensuring proper implementation for safety. they must only be used where adequate lane width, as per irc standards, is available between lane lines or the edgecenter line. if sufficient width is not maintained, markings should be avoided to prevent side-swipe accidents. broken traffic lanes can be crossed whereas continuous traffic lanes shall not be crossed and shall be white in colour. lm31 is of 15000 mm length with 3000 mm gap length and 200 mm width and shall be white in colour (as per table a.1). irc:35-2015 4.2
7 non-retroreflective road sign u-turn prohibited sign the u-turn prohibited sign indicates areas where vehicles are not allowed to reverse their direction of travel. it should be placed at the start and at intervals along road sections where this restriction is enforced by the controlling authority. the maximum spacing between two successive signs should not exceed 120 meters on each side of the road. the sign is circular with a red border, a red oblique bar, a white background, and a black symbol. the sign is circular with a red border, a red oblique bar, a white background, and a black symbol. its size depends on design speed: up to 65 kmh (300 mm diameter, 35 mm border and oblique bar, 75 mm font; or 600 mm diameter, 50 mm border and bar, 100 mm font), 6680 kmh (750 mm diameter, 60 mm border and oblique bar, 125 mm font), 81100 kmh (900 mm diameter, 75 mm border and oblique bar, 150 mm font), 101120 kmh (1200 mm diameter, 100 mm border and oblique bar, 225 mm font), and 121150 kmh (1500 mm diameter, 125 mm border and oblique bar, 250 mm font).
46 placement issue traffic calming measures speed hump the profile of circular shaped hump is based on the shape of a circular arc with a radius varying from 11 m to 113 m and a chord length varying from 3.0 m to 9.5 m to achieve desired speed of 20 kmh to 50 kmh. circular shaped humps with rises less than assumed 10 cm will result in higher speeds than those mentioned. rises that are higher than 10 cm may cause damage to vehicles.at 20 kmh, the radius is 11 m, the chord length is 3.0 m, and the bus speed during passage is 5 kmh;at 25 kmh, the radius is 15 m, the chord length is 3.5 m, and the bus speed during passage is 10 kmh;at 30 kmh, the radius is 20 m, the chord length is 4.0 m, and the bus speed during passage is 15 kmh;at 35 kmh, the radius is 31 m, the chord length is 5.0 m, and the bus speed during passage is 20 kmh;at 40 kmh, the radius is 53 m, the chord length is 6.5 m, and the bus speed during passage is 25 kmh;at 45 kmh, the radius is 80 m, the chord length is 8.0 m, and the bus speed during passage is 30 kmh;at 50 kmh, the radius is 113 m, the chord length is 9.5 m, and the bus speed during passage is 35 kmh (as per clause 3.1.1.1 of irc:99-2018).
36 placement issue road marking chevron diverging marking channelizing markings like chevron diverging marking are utilized to demarcate the neutral area at the nose of a channelizing island which can help in reducing the incidence of collision with kerb nose. they direct the exiting traffic into the proper angle for smooth movements of divergence. these markings provide for proper and safe use of deceleration lanes. the basic function is to inform the driver about the arealane(s) which is set aside for the exclusive use of traffic on the main highway and thus enable the driver to adequately distinguish between through traffic lanes and the deceleration lanes. the spacing of chevron markings shall be 2 m for markings for less than 10 m (hm01), 4 m for markings 10 to 22 m marking (hm02) and 6 m for markings greater than 22 m (hm03). wdith of chevron measures at right angles to the diagonals or chevrons is 600 mm. the total length of chevron markings depends on the lateral shift undertaken by a vehicle in motion and varies with site conditions and the length should be such that to accommodate at least two or three chevrons or diagonals. the diverging chevrons must always point towards approaching traffic. the gap between chevron and boundary line shall be 100 mm to facilitate drain of surface run off. the chevron diverging marking shall be white in colour (as per table a.3). irc:35-2015 7.2
