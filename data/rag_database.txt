Bi-directional carriageways shall have two coloured faces which can be a combination of two colours such as Red-White bi-directional road studs or same colour on two faces like white-white bi-directional road studs or Yellow-Yellow bi-directional road studs. Road studs for four lane divided road, with carriageway width greater than 7.3 m carriageway width is as follows (as per Table 5.2):
For normal section: yellow-yellow bidirectional at 18 m interval for centre line (desriable one), red-white bidirectional at 18 m interval for edge line (optional one) and for traffic lane line is not required.
For warning section: yellow-yellow bidirectional at 9 m interval for centre line (desriable one), red-white bidirectional at 9 m interval for edge line (desirable one) and for traffic lane line is not required.
For no overtaking section: yellow-yellow bidirectional at 6 m interval for centre line (desriable one), red-white bidirectional at 6 m interval for edge line (desirable one) and white-white bidirectional at 6 m interval for traffic lane line (optional one).
For divided road, in warning section: white-white bidirectional at 9 m interval (optional one) for traffic lane line shall be given.
Road studs must be placed at the center of the gap, never on or beside the line segment at broken longitudinal Markings. Road studs should be 50 mm outside the shoulder edge line, on carriageway with Paved Shoulder. With No Paved Shoulder, roadstuds can be placed directly on the edge line due to space constraints. Road studs should be in the hard strip or kerb shyness width, with 50 mm setback from the median side edge line and 100 mm clearance from the raised kerb on Median Side Edge. Only 50 mm setback is required for Flushed or Depressed Medians; 100 mm clearance is not applicable. If space is insufficient, studs can be placed adjacent to or directly on the edge line. Road Studs with Anchorages is preferable for edge lines but not recommended for concrete roads. Proper installation is required to avoid pavement damage."	IRC:35-2015	5.3
40	Placement Issue	Road Marking	Broken Traffic Lane Line Marking	The carriageway having two or more in one direction are divided into separate lanes by traffic lane line marking for vehicles to move in proper lanes and to discourage the meandering tendency of the drivers, thereby promoting safety and ensuring maximum capacity. Traffic lane markings should be applied near pedestrian crossings, hazardous locations, congested areas, and important one-way streets, ensuring proper implementation for safety. They must only be used where adequate lane width, as per IRC standards, is available between lane lines or the edge/center line. If sufficient width is not maintained, markings should be avoided to prevent side-swipe accidents. Broken traffic lanes can be crossed whereas continuous traffic lanes shall not be crossed and shall be white in colour. LM31 is of 15000 mm length with 3000 mm gap length and 200 mm width and shall be white in colour (as per Table A.1).	IRC:35-2015	4.2

protection. To be effective, footpaths must be of adequate width, well maintained, and free
from obstructions, including parked vehicles, signs, traders, and so forth.
Footpaths are included as standard infrastructure in many countries as it is accepted wisdom
that they produce improvements for pedestrian. The evidence indicates benefits of up to 60
percent reductions for pedestrians from the installation of footpaths.48 49 50
A.1.11 PEDESTRIAN CROSSINGS
A variety of pedestrian crossing types can be applied at intersections or at other locations
where there is demand. Crossing types include low cost measures such as marked priority
crossings (“zebra crossings”), signal-controlled crossings, raised crossings (an area of
elevated pavement surface, preferably with pedestrian priority), or pedestrian under- or over-
passes. Marked priority crossings (“zebra crossings”) often have limited impact in LMICs, and
may even increase risk if not installed at appropriate locations and with adequate features (for
instance, higher speed environments with multiple lanes in situations where there is poor sight
distance, or where compliance is poor). Similarly, under- and over-passes, especially in urban
settings that dramatically increase the distance and effort of pedestrians to cross a road, or
that result in personal security issues, may provide little benefit.
Other facilities to assist pedestrians when crossing include road narrowing, refuge islands,
and slow speed environments (Figure A.8). Improving visibility including through better sight
distance and lighting can also have benefits.
Figure A.8: Pedestrian crossing incorporating speed reduction devices.
(Source: Lusakatimes, 2019)
There is little reliable information on benefits of pedestrian crossings in LMICs, but there is
extensive information from HICs. There the benefits range from around a 40 percent reduction
in pedestrian injuries from installation of a refuge island,51 up to around 70 percent reductions

from use of raised pedestrian crossings and low speed environments.52 53 54 55 Interventions
that rely solely on motorized vehicle compliance to produce benefits (such as priority crossing
without speed control) are very unlikely to have substantial benefits where compliance levels
are low.
A.1.12 SEPARATED BICYCLE FACILITIES
Bicyclists are vulnerable road users and so it is important to provide adequate facilities so that
they can use roads safely. This is particularly the case when motorized vehicles speeds are
in excess of 30 km/h. Collisions above this speed often result in very serious injuries or even
death. Facilities include off-road paths, on-road lanes (preferably separated from both passing
vehicles and parked vehicles), and dedicated facilities at intersections (signalized crossings,
protected intersections, areas of high contrast road surfacing, off-road bypass facilities, and
bicycle storage boxes).
Evaluations on the effectiveness of such facilities can be difficult, because the design may be
of variable quality, or because improved provision often results in a dramatic increase in
bicycle numbers and so crash numbers may appear to increase in some instances.56 This is
an issue that can also occur for other road user types with the provision of higher quality roads.
Reductions of around 15 percent in cyclist injuries have been noted from the use of cycle lanes
adjacent to traffic,57 58 while higher benefits have been seen with more comprehensive
interventions, such as bicycle boulevards.59
A.1.13 SEPARATED MOTORCYCLE FACILITIES
Motorcycle riders are very vulnerable road users given their lack of physical protection and
often high travel speed. Serious injuries and death are common when larger vehicles collide
with this road user group, especially at speeds higher than 30 km/h. The proportion of
motorcycle riders is high in many countries, and in these environments, separate lanes are
sometimes provided to reduce exposure between these vulnerable road users and larger
vehicles. These lanes can be provided on or adjacent to existing roads with segregation
provided by painted lines or (preferably) through physical separation such as physical barriers.
In some cases, exclusive lanes are provided for motorcycles (Figure A.9) and these provided
an added advantage with reduced interaction at intersections with other vehicles.

Although the use of separated motorcycle facilities is relatively limited, there has been a steady
increase in use over recent years. For example, there are approximately 135km of exclusive
lanes and 110 km of non-exclusive lanes in Malaysia on expressways and major federal
roads.60 Evaluations of motorcycle lanes can be difficult for much the same reason as bicycle
lanes (including issue of changed exposure and variable design), and because applications to
date have been limited. However, results for evaluations of exclusive lanes indicate the
number of traffic crashes has decreased by almost 40 percent, and fatalities by 80 percent.61

A.1.14 OTHER INTERSECTION IMPROVEMENTS
In addition to those improvements already mentioned above (including speed reduction,
roundabouts, grade separation, and reductions in exposure) a variety of other improvements
can be made at intersections to provide safety benefits. These includes low cost (and typically
lower benefit) interventions such as warning signs and introduction of priority signs (Give
Way/Yield and Stop signs), through to more substantive infrastructure improvement with
higher costs, but also typically higher benefits (these include improved facilities such as turning
lanes and channelization, and improved intersection visibility). One of the more commonly-
used interventions is traffic signals. When well designed (including provision of fully controlled
turns) and when used in moderate speed environments (including provision of speed-reducing
features to reduce speeds to survival impact levels of 50 km/h or less), these can produce
quite reasonable benefits. Reduction in injury crashes of around 30 percent are typical for
basic traffic signal installations where there is good compliance, but higher benefits can be
achieved with addition of controlled turns and speed reduction.49 44 46 Other more innovative
intersection designs are being tested in various countries with some showing great potential.38
A.1.15 SIGNS AND LINE MARKING
There are a range of signs and line marking as well as other options that can provide advanced
warning of hazards and provide guidance to road users about their required position on the
road. These are particularly useful where there is reduced visibility (including at night, see

Figure A.10) or when approaching bends or curves in the road. Options are relatively low cost,
and although they can also produce valuable safety benefits, these are typically less than
those from more substantive infrastructure and speed-related solutions. Reductions in injury
crashes range from around 5 percent for guideposts and raised reflectorized pavement
markers up to around 25 percent for chevron alignment markers, provision of center and
edgeline markings, and warning signs.49 44 46 When various delineation treatments are used
in combination at high-risk locations and as part of mass action, route-based programs, higher
benefits may be achieved.62

A.1.16 AUDIO-TACTILE LINE MARKING
Various forms of rumble strips or audio tactile line marking have emerged in recent years.
These are either raised sections (often in thermoplastic) or milled (cut) into the road surface.
They can be placed along the road (longitudinally) either on the road edge (on or adjacent to
the edgeline) as in Figure A.11, or in the center of the road, or they can be used across the
road (transverse markings) as shown in Figure A.12. When driven over, these devices alert
motorists via vibration and sound. In the case of longitudinal markings, they warn motorists
that they are leaving their traffic lane (often due to inattention or fatigue). When used across
the road they can inform motorists that there is a hazard ahead. These interventions reduce
crashes by around 20-30 percent.49 63

A.1.17 IMPROVING SURFACING ON POOR QUALITY ROADS WITHOUT ADDITIONAL
INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENT
An assumption is often made that when paving a road (that is, from dirt or unsurfaced roads
to concrete or aggregate surfacing) or improving the current road surface, safety benefits will
ensue. However, increases in risk can occur, especially if other improvements
(specifically for safety) are not made at the same time. This is particularly true in LMICs
where the quality of the road before resurfacing can be very poor, leading to very low speeds.64
Road surface improvements can lead to substantially higher traffic speeds, and if other
measures are not taken to improve safety for vulnerable road users (for example, provision of
footpaths, traffic calming) or for motorists (including improvements at intersections and curves,
roadside management, improved sight distance, and so forth) crashes are likely to increase.
Given the knowledge base on the increase in crash risk for any given road with increases in
speed 65 66 67 (also see the following section on speed interventions), it is expected that such
improvements will result in large increases in risk, even when taking into account
improvements in road surface friction, vehicle stability, and other possible benefits. Further
details can be found in Case Study 3 below.
64 One study with a limited sample in India found that speeds dropped by 30-40 km/h for inter-urban roads when roughness increased
substantially – see Ch.Ravi Sekhar, J.Nataraju, S.Velmurugan, Pradeep Kumar and K.Sitaramanjaneyulu (2016). Free Flow Speed Analysis of

CASE STUDY 3 – SURFACE IMPROVEMENTS
Tanzania received funding to upgrade the 140 km Mafinga to Igawa Road which had
deteriorated drastically due to pavement aging. However, following a spate of
serious crashes, the World Bank requested that iRAP undertake a rapid road safety
assessment of the upgraded corridor. An investigation identified various hazards.
This included that although 30km/h speed limit signs are present throughout the
road, estimated operating speeds are often above 80km/h, well above the speeds
before the upgrade occurred. On many sections of the road pedestrians are present,
as shown in the example below. These pedestrians are now exposed to high levels
of risk given this increase in speed.
Among other actions, it was recommended that sidewalks be installed on
approximately 7km of roads in villages and urban areas and that pedestrian
crossings and traffic calming be installed. Work will be completed later in 2020, but
already many of these recommendations have already been addressed. This will
produce significant benefits to this vulnerable road user group.

A.2 SAFE SPEED
A.2.1 INTRODUCTION
There is a direct, causal link between speed and safety outcomes. Indeed, there are no other
risk factors that have such a substantial and pervasive impact on safety as speed. Speed has
an impact on both the likelihood of a crash occurring, and severity of the outcome when
crashes do occur.
There is very strong evidence about the impact of changes in speed on crash risk.68 69 70
Figure A.13 provides information on change in speed for rural roads and freeways. This
highlights that the more severe crash types (especially fatal crashes) increase the most with
a change in speed. Conversely, the more severe crash types improve the most with a
reduction in speed.
Figure A.13: Relationship between change in speed and change in crash risk. Source: Elvik 200966
In many instances increasing vehicle speeds is an important economic objective. Economic
improvement can only be achieved if there is a subsequent improvement in the safety
of the road itself to prevent the increased costs of crashes countering the economic
benefits of reduced travel time. Indeed, freeways and motorways are our fastest, but also
typically our safest, roads. These roads can maintain safe mobility through the high quality of
the infrastructure that is provided. This includes proper roadside and median protection (for
example, through barrier systems), protecting road users at intersections through provision of
grade separation and on- and off-ramps, and ensuring that vulnerable road users are

separated from faster moving traffic. In situations where there is no form of access control or
these other safe infrastructure measures, severe crashes will undoubtedly increase if speeds
increase. This highlights the need for a clear functional road classification and the provision of
infrastructure to meet the needs and speeds of relevant road users.
It is often thought that increased speeds will have a subsequent economic benefit. The
relationship between vehicle speed and other economic objectives is demonstrated in Figure
A.14.
Figure A.14: Increases in speed have large impacts on multiple components of travel
cost. Source: Hosseinlou et al., 2015)71
With the increase in speeds, travel time is reduced (although generally not as much as many
think due to issues such as congestion, presence of intersections, and so forth), but at the
same time, costs for fuel consumption, pollutants, and road crashes increase. The optimal
speed of vehicles when including these broader societal objectives is generally less than many
people think.
Various guides exist highlighting the links between speed and safety outcomes, as well as
effective methods for managing speeds. Examples include:

manual for decision-makers and practitioners[](http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2008/9782940395040_eng.pdf)

and Safety Sciences, 39(1):36-41.
28
• Austroads Urban Speed Compendium[](https://austroads.com.au/publications/road-safety/ap-r514-16).
Appropriate speeds need to be constantly reviewed, particularly in areas where there is
changing land use and an increasing presence of vulnerable road users. As an example, in
many LMICs, cities and even rural townships are expanding along highway corridors that were
designed to cater for high-speed intercity traffic. These corridors need to be reviewed and
appropriate speed management and infrastructure provisions put in place. Ultimately many of
these locations need to be rebuilt as urban streets.
Details on some specific speed-related interventions can be found in the remainder of this
section.
A.2.2 TRAFFIC CALMING INCLUDING HUMPS, CHICANES
Various road infrastructure devices can be used to effectively manage the speed of vehicles.
Humps (Figure A.15) and platforms refer to raised sections of pavement, with various forms
of speed humps and platforms available for different road types and speed environments.
Chicanes provide another mechanism for slowing vehicles through horizontal deflection (or
movement) of vehicles. Again, the designs can vary depending on the degree of speed control
desired, as well as the operating environment. These interventions can be used at high risk
locations (such as areas where pedestrians and other vulnerable road users need to cross) or
as part of an integrated area-wide traffic calming scheme.
Figure A.15: Traffic calming/Speed Hump (Source: NACTO)
Well-designed traffic calming can produce substantial safety benefits. Reductions of around
35 percent for all injury crashes are typical, but much higher benefits are likely for pedestrians
and other vulnerable road users (around a 70 percent reduction in fatal and serious pedestrian
injury).49 50 55 72

A.2.3 ROUNDABOUTS
Roundabouts have been included here as well as within the section on Safe Roads due to
their substantial impact on speed reduction when designed and installed correctly. For further
details, please see the content in Section A.1.7.
A.2.4 RAISED INTERSECTIONS
Raised intersections (also known as raised junctions or plateaus) are raised sections of
pavement with ramps designed to reduce speeds to required levels (typically 50 km/h in the
absence of vulnerable road users, and lower where they are present). The whole intersection
can be raised or alternatively, raised sections can be placed in advance of the intersection
(sometimes referred to as raised stop bars).
Benefits of around 40 percent reductions in injury crashes are likely with this intervention52 72
with higher benefits likely for vulnerable road users.
A.2.5 RAISED CROSSINGS
Raised pedestrian crossings are flat-top speed humps that also provide priority to pedestrians
rather than motorists. They typically consist of a raised platform with a marked pedestrian
crossing on top (Figure A.16). A central refuge and narrowing may also be provided,
particularly on wider roads. Additional humps may be used in advance of the crossing to
further reduce vehicle speeds. The raised crossing slows vehicles and also increases the
visibility of pedestrians due to the increased height.
Figure A.16: Raised pedestrian crossing (Source: GRSF)
This treatment can result in substantial safety improvements for both motorized road users
and pedestrians (65 percent and 75 percent respectively.52 53 46 72
30
A.2.6 GATEWAY TREATMENTS
Gateway treatments (also called entry treatments or thresholds) are used to mark the
transition points between a higher speed environment to a lower speed environment. They
are particularly useful when approaching a town or village. Speed reductions are achieved
through the use of speed signs (these may be larger than normal) and road narrowing (either
through constructed islands or through painted markings). In some cases, raised pavements
are used (Figure A.17), or colored or textured pavements used instead.
Figure A.17: Gateway treatment between a high speed and low speed environment
(Source: World Bank)
These interventions can be cheap to install, but produce substantial benefits in regards to
severe crash outcomes. They are particularly useful for reducing fatal and serious injuries to
vulnerable road users. Reductions of around 40 percent of fatal and serious injuries are
possible.73 74 75
A.2.7 LOWER SPEED LIMITS
This intervention involves lowering the posted speed limits using static signs towards safer
levels. This is a widely applied speed management measure aimed at producing lower vehicle
speeds, and crash and injury severity reductions. Speed limits should be set based on the
most vulnerable road users present and as part of an integrated strategy that addresses safe
mobility. Depending on other road and traffic elements (including the surrounding land use,
traffic mix, and volumes) the reduced speed might need to be supported by other infrastructure
solutions to provide “self-explaining roads” and to help ensure that motorized road users
understand speeds and thereby improve compliance.

Research Laboratory, Crowthorne, UK.
31
The safety benefits from a change in the speed limit will depend on the magnitude of change
and the level of compliance. A 10 km/h reduction in a speed limit could be expected to produce
around a 15 percent reduction in injury crashes, and up to around a 40 percent reduction in
pedestrian fatal and serious injuries, but in the right circumstances, benefits can be greater
than these.49 50 57
A.2.8 30 KM/H (20 MPH) ZONES FOR PEDESTRIANS
Many of the solutions highlighted in this section can be used in combination to create low
speed environments (Figure A.18) which provide a greater degree of safety for vulnerable
road users, including pedestrians. As indicated above, pedestrians have a reasonably good
chance of surviving when struck by vehicles at or below 30 km/h, but above this speed, the
chances of survival reduce dramatically. Reduction in serious injuries to pedestrians can be
very high with this treatment (in excess of 70 percent49 54 55) and there will also be high benefits
for other road users in these environments.

A.2.9 SPEED CAMERAS
Speed cameras are devices that are mounted on the side of the road, above the road, or in
vehicles to detect speeding vehicles. They may be fixed (at a set location) or mobile (Figure
A.19). In some situations, two or more cameras are used to detect average speed of vehicles.
Speed cameras differ from traditional speed enforcement in that photographs of the vehicle
and license plate are taken, and a citation is mailed to the vehicle owner. This eliminates the
need for a police officer to intercept the speeder. To work effectively, automated cameras
require license plates to be clearly displayed on vehicles and need to have a robust
administrative system to issue fines. Guidance is available on establishing speed camera
programs.76

Speed Cameras and Other Automated Enforcement. Global Road Safety Facility and the Global
Road Safety Partnership, Geneva, Switzerland.
32
The introduction of speed cameras combined with the promotion of enforcement activity is
very effective safety intervention. For example, evaluation of the first 28 speed cameras
introduced in the state of New South Wales, Australia, revealed a 71 percent reduction in
speeding, which delivered an 89 percent reduction in deaths at the treated locations.77 Other
studies show consistent though somewhat smaller reductions in trauma.78 Reduced speeds
also deliver large reductions in fatalities and injuries for pedestrians.79

A.2.10 INCREASING TRAVEL SPEED WITHOUT IMPROVING QUALITY OF INFRASTRUCTURE
As identified at the start of this section, when speeds increase and there are no subsequent
improvements in infrastructure to support this higher speed and to protect vulnerable road
users, crash risk will increase. As identified in the previous section (Section A.1.17) this can
occur when road surface improvements are made on poor quality existing road alignments
and/or where vulnerable road users are present. It is clear from the evidence that increases
in speed without subsequent improvement in infrastructure has harmful impacts.

A.3 SAFE ROAD USERS
A.3.1 INTRODUCTION
Changing road user behavior has been the focus of activity for road safety practitioners for
many decades. Given that many crashes are in some way caused by road user error, it would
seem obvious that improving behavior would be the first option for improving road safety.
However, changing behavior to produce safety benefits still brings significant challenges and
sometimes only very limited benefits. More effective solutions to address road user
often be found in other Safe System pillars. For example, it is possible to engineer roads to
provide very direct visual cues to road users on the appropriate speed, or even to constrain
speeds through physical measures. This is typically more effective than telling drivers about
the risks of higher speeds and telling them they should slow down. Similarly, vehicle
technologies play an increasing role in safely managing driver behavior through various
warning systems, partial automation (for example automatic emergency braking), and vehicle
management systems (for example seatbelt reminders systems and alcohol interlocks).
The often limited impact of some road user interventions is not surprising given the current
knowledge of safety science. The well-established “Hierarchy of Control”, which stems from
the industrial health and safety field, highlights measures to minimize or eliminate exposure to
hazards80 and is shown in Figure A.20.
Figure A.20: Hierarchy of Controls. (Source CDC 202081)
Based on this approach, the most effective interventions are those that eliminate the hazard,
followed by substitution of the hazard, and then engineering controls (which may include seat
belts and airbags in the road safety context). Behavioral interventions which generally fall
under administrative controls are at the lower-end of the effectiveness scale since they require
constant supervision and vigilant enforcement, supported by continuous training as new
people enter the system. At a population level, such interventions often involve a large amount
80 For a discussion on the Hierarchy of Control from a Safe System perspective, please see McTiernen, D & Rensen, A (2016), The Safe System
Hierarchy of Control Framework for Local Roads, Proceedings of the 2016 Australasian Road Safety Conference, Canberra, Australia.

34
of resources to reach the desired number of people to make a measurable impact. Instead,
the greatest successes typically come when we can eliminate a hazard entirely (for example,
by putting motorized traffic and pedestrians on non-overlapping, non-conflicting paths).
As noted previously, improving road user behavior is a key element of the Safe System
approach, and there are important actions that need to be taken to improve road safety
through this mechanism. Methods used for improving road user behavior include
implementation of driver licensing, training, education, enforcement, monitoring (for example,
through vehicle telematics) and road safety campaigns. As shown in the summary table in
Section 2, although there is some clear evidence that road user behavior can be improved,
there are several popular road user interventions which have been found to be
ineffective or even harmful for reducing fatal and serious injuries. The remainder of this
section provides an overview of the evidence base on effectiveness of safe road user
interventions.
A.3.2 DRIVER LICENSING SYSTEMS THAT INCLUDE EXTENSIVE ON-ROAD SUPERVISED
PRACTICE
Driver licensing systems that ensure novice drivers are required to undertake many hours of
supervised on-road driving has proven to be effective.82 83 While safety benefits are shown,
the reason for them is not certain. Benefits may arise from learning safer habits, such as
adhering to speed limits and wearing a safety belt, and from better scanning and anticipation
of other road users, but also because the age of driving is increased (see Section A.3.5 for
evidence on the importance of this issue). A number of countries have moved to systems
where this extensive on-road supervision is required, often as part of a Graduated Licensing
System (or GLS, see Section A.3.3). Given that this on-road experience is typically coupled
with other elements of GLS, it is hard to determine the impact of this element alone.
There are limited indications that structured pre-license training can produce a safety benefit.
One review84 reported on research from Denmark that found structured training by a qualified
driving instructor and involving classroom instruction, car control skills, defensive driving, and
hazard perception (see Section A.3.6) can produce safer drivers, in this case a reduction in
multi-car collisions, but not single vehicle collisions, in the first year of driving. However, this
study was based on self-reports of crash involvement and suffered from a limited
methodology. It was noted in the review84 that studies on this topic typically suffer from
methodological limitations.85 The review clearly highlighted that training may be associated
with poorer on-road safety outcomes if this results in reduced hours of supervised training or
accelerated attainment of license. In summary, license systems involving extensive on-road
supervised training as part of a GLS are the preferred form of licensing system.

supervised practice. Accident Analysis & Prevention, 35(5), 725-730.

driver training, Safety Science, 51, 127–137.
85Studies of this type would ideally involve “randomization” of subjects into different groups, but typically this does not occur. Randomization
means that those completing training are randomly allocated into this group, while others are randomly allocated into a group that is not trained,
or receives some other alternative. This minimizes potential biases (such as self-selection bias) meaning that differences in performance between
groups can be attributed to differences in training.
35
A.3.3 GRADUATED LICENSING SYSTEMS
GLS typically combines extensive supervised on-road training with a phased approach to
driving. Initially drivers are restricted in how they can drive (for example, with initial limitations
on passenger numbers; zero alcohol tolerance; restricting vehicles that can be driven). GLS
coupled with supervised on-road driver training has been found to be effective with a 20 to 30
percent reduction in novice driver fatal and serious injury.83 86
A.3.4 LICENSE THROUGH APPLICATION OR PAYMENT
In contrast, driver licensing systems that do not include extensive on-road supervised training
and GLS will therefore be less effective. Many countries do not include these components
within their driver licensing systems. Systems that rely on a simple application process, or
situations where more rigorous licensing regimes can be subverted through payment,
are not likely to be effective and should be avoided and other alternatives provided in this
section should be used. However, having a robust licensing system is likely to bring some
road safety benefits as this provides a mechanism to monitor driver violations (such as
speeding) and therefore provides an incentive for road users to comply with regulations. In
many countries, licenses can be suspended or canceled if drivers exceed certain conditions
(also see Section A.3.11 on penalties).
A.3.5 INCREASE AGE FOR DRIVING LICENSE ELIGIBILITY
A link between driver age, experience, and crash risk has been firmly established. Drivers in
their first year are three to four times as likely to have a crash compared to a more experienced
driver.87 This risk peaks in the first few months of driving and decreases rapidly after about 6-
8 months of driving experience.88 Part of this high risk is related to lack of skills and experience
and driving in higher risk situations, but there is clear evidence that driver’s cognitive maturity
also plays a significant part. Studies on younger versus older novice drivers indicate that the
younger drivers have greater crash risk than their older counterparts.89 Therefore, one way to
reduce injuries and deaths is to delay the age at which young people are eligible to obtain a
license. This is likely to be one of the mechanisms by which GLS systems work given that they
delay the onset of driving (along with other elements). Evidence also suggests that increasing
driving age will also have a beneficial impact on safety outcomes.90 Increasing driving age by
1 year is likely to produce a 5-10 percent reduction in the crash rate for the first year of
Driving.49
A.3.6 HAZARD PERCEPTION TRAINING AND TESTING
Hazard perception refers to a road user’s ability to anticipate potentially dangerous situations
on the road ahead. This skill typically takes many years of experience to acquire. Hazard
perception skill can be measured using computer-based hazard-perception tests, and
similarly, hazard perception training can be provided, typically as part of comprehensive
novice driver licensing regimes. Hazard perception testing and training appear to have the

drivers, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews.

36
capability to reduce crash risk. For example, the inclusion of a hazard-perception test in the
UK driver licensing process has been estimated to reduce drivers’ high speed road crash rates
by about 10 percent in the year following their test.91
A.3.7 POST-LICENSE DRIVER AND RIDER EDUCATION AND TRAINING
Once drivers and riders have received their licenses (preferably through a robust system as
outlined above) there are often demands to build on the basic skills obtained through various
types of education and training. Despite faith in this post-license education and training,
general passenger car driver training is proven repeatedly to be ineffective, or even
harmful, for road safety. The highly credible Cochrane Library has published rigorous
reviews of the evidence which have shown no safety benefits of driver training. The review of
post-license driver training evaluations concluded that there is: “…. no evidence that post-
license driver education is effective in preventing road traffic injuries or crashes. …. Because
of the large number of participants included in the meta-analysis (close to 300,000 for some
outcomes) we can exclude, with reasonable precision, the possibility of even modest
benefits.”92 The analysis of the evidence also found that: “No one form of education … was
found to be substantially more effective than another, nor was a significant difference found
between advanced driver education and remedial driver education.”92 More recent reviews
have demonstrated increases in crash rates from vehicle handling skills-based training such
as skid training. Although this result might seem counter-intuitive, the simplest way to
understand this is that any benefits that might arise through training are greatly out-weighed
by the over-confidence imparted in those involved in these courses. This is illustrated in the
example in Case Study 3 below.

CASE STUDY 3 – SKID TRAINING
Skid control (or “skid pan”) training is intended to teach drivers how to control their
vehicle if they encounter slippery road surface conditions, including on wet roads and
from snow, ice, oil, or debris. Slippery surface conditions are artificially created in an
off-road setting. The training often promises “advanced driving skills” to help tackle
these dangerous conditions, and intuitively, acquiring such experience seems to make
sense. However, there is considerable evidence that such training contributes to
increased crash risk. This negative outcome has been replicated from numerous
studies, including those conducted in Europe, North America, Australia, and New
Zealand.
One of the main reasons that such training is not effective is that any benefits obtained
through improved knowledge or skills are out-weighed by a greater risk from over-
confidence following such training. Driver skills training is shown to increase
confidence93 94 (making existing general over-confidence worse93) and increased
confidence is associated with increased risk taking.95

In some LMICs, post-license training may be seen as a way to make up for poor licensing
systems (see Section A.3.4) where drivers and riders commence on-road activity without any
of the required skills or experience. It is unlikely that a small number of post-license training
sessions would provide the required experience for safe road use, and as the evidence from
elsewhere shows, there is a very real chance that this will result in increased risk. Even if such
training and education was shown to have benefits (which it has not), these types of
interventions fall at the bottom of the hierarchy of control (see Section A.3.1). Immense
resource would be required to train an adequate number of road users to have any beneficial
impact, and continued training is likely to be required. It is highly recommended that new road

enforcement, a mass media campaign has virtually no direct effect in terms of reducing the
number of crashes, but in combination, these measures can lead to a reduction in crashes.112
As one clear example, seatbelt use in the state of New South Wales, Australia, only increased
slightly from baselines to over 20 percent by strong advertising of the risks of injury and death.
However, good advertising of impending enforcement of seatbelt use resulted in a sudden
increase in usage rate to over 95 percent, which with further refinement of enforcement and
promotion increased to over 99 percent. The fear of a fine is clearly more effective.113
Similarly, despite extensive education and campaigning on the dangers of drink-driving, an
alarming 42 percent of deaths involved drink-driving. Yet with the introduction of a strong
campaign warning about impending extensive random breath testing, driving-driving deaths
dropped dramatically.114 The drop in drink-driving deaths even preceded the beginning of the
random breath testing enforcement, demonstrating the impact of the advance warning
communications campaign. Campaigns work best when alternative behaviors are provided.112
For example, in a drink driving campaign (to reduce driving while intoxicated) it would be useful
to highlight alternative forms of transport or the importance of selecting a designated sober
driver instead of driving under the influence of alcohol.
In addition, educational interventions may operate through an indirect route by changing road
users’ perceptions about risks of an activity.115 For example, an intervention that made the
target audience more aware of the dangers of speeding may not directly change behavior, but
rather may increase awareness of the problem to a level whereby the introduction of a speed
camera enforcement program is possible. That camera program would ultimately have an
impact on driver behavior. Similarly, education at a very local level about a new road safety
intervention (for example, roundabouts when these have not been widely used) may help
improve the understanding and use for that intervention and also the acceptability of this if a
clear benefit is highlighted.
A key reason for the limited effectiveness of campaigns on their own is that it is often assumed
that providing information on risks will change driver behavior either through greater
knowledge and/or fear of likely outcomes. However, drivers are subject to established habits,
biases, situational factors, misjudgments of personal risk (including optimism bias), and
sometimes, irrational behavior. It is very difficult to change behavior through campaigns
(especially those based on crash risk) given these factors. In addition, such messages are
often soon forgotten. Moreover, as identified in previous sections, these types of interventions
generally fall at the lower end of the effectiveness scale within the hierarchy of control and
require constant reminders as well as enforcement to be effective (as demonstrated by the
evidence within this section).
A.3.10 ENFORCEMENT
Enforcement is a key element for reducing fatal and serious injuries. When implemented well,
enforcement and the threat of sanctions (such as fines and potential loss of license) act to
deter road users from participating in adverse behavior. Deterrence theory highlights that
individuals will avoid offending if they fear the perceived consequences of the behavior,
especially if the consequences of conducting in this behavior are seen as outweighing the

likely benefits.116 117 This deterrence therefore requires an awareness of illegal behaviors; a
belief that there is a probability of detection; and a belief that the consequences of detection
will be negative.116 For this reason, enforcement is most effective when combined with
campaigns highlighting risks and consequences of being caught (see Section A.3.9).
Deterrence can be general or specific. General deterrence assumes that the general motoring
public who have not experienced sanctions before will be deterred from offending by the threat
of punishment, as a result of awareness of others being punished for offending, or through
being warned through media campaigns of impending penalties for offending.116 117 Therefore,
for general deterrence, the target is the general population of motorists. Specific deterrence
relates to offenders who have already experienced sanctions, and assumes these road users
will be dissuaded from committing the same offense in future through fear of incurring further
sanctions.
There are a range of road safety enforcement measures that have been shown to improve
road user behavior. Implementation of intensive police programs—focused on: (i) speed;
(ii) impaired driving (alcohol118); and, (ii) seat belt usage—is associated with average
reductions varying between 20 and 30 per cent of road crashes with injuries.119 Helmet
wearing produces clear safety benefits, and enforcement of helmet wearing laws substantially
increases helmet wearing rates.120 Safety cameras, driving license suspension, and a zero
blood-alcohol content (BAC) limit for young drivers are very cost-effective measures.121
As identified above, enforcement can be combined with campaigns to increase impact.
Such enforcement has traditionally been undertaken by police, but recently a stronger role has
been taken by fleet managers and even insurance companies. This has occurred with the
advent of in-vehicle monitoring devices, particularly for speed compliance. The effectiveness
of these systems is currently being evaluated.
A.3.11 PENALTIES
Enforcement regimes need to be linked to penalties, and these must be certain and
unavoidable. When coupled with legislative change, enforcement, and broader campaigns,
penalties can be an effective method for reducing road trauma.122 123
There is clear evidence that greater certainty of punishment is associated with lower offense
rates. Similarly, more extensive use of penalties is more effective than scarce or sporadic
use.124 One study of six countries125 found that fewer traffic violations are committed by drivers

118 Enforcement of drug driving has commenced in several countries, but evidence on the effectiveness of this is currently not available. There are multiple
differences between drug-driving and drink-driving which mean that the simple extrapolation from the success of drink-driving enforcement to drug-driving
enforcement may be misleading. These include, the many forms of drug to be tested, differences in habitual users of illicit drugs versus legal alcohol
consumption, the lack of sound dose-response curves for drug impairments, and the higher cost of drug testing, which prevents pervasive testing with large
numbers of tests as deployed in drink-driving enforcement.

in countries with strong enforcement compared with drivers in countries with relaxed
enforcement because of their awareness of the consequences of these violations.
For some offense types, penalties should be graduated based on severity of activity, with
higher penalties for greater levels of violation or for repeated behavior. For example,
consideration should be given toward loss of license and vehicle impoundment for high-speed
offenders or for repeat offenders. Individuals will be less likely to commit an offense or to
reoffend if the perceived punishment for that offense is severe126.
Penalties should be issued as quickly as possible, and there is evidence that if the punishment
is administered immediately after the offence is committed, then the offender will be less likely
to reoffend.124 127 Delays in the issuing of a fine can often lead to denial of the offense,
inaccuracy of memory recall, and the potential to continue to offend. With modern technology
(including SMS messaging), it is likely that infringements could be issued quickly using means
other than postal mail.
A.3.12 ALCOHOL INTERLOCKS
Alcohol interlocks (Figure A.21) require drivers to provide a sample of breath before the vehicle
can start, and may require repeat samples throughout a journey. If alcohol is detected, then
vehicles are prevented from starting. Modern systems reduce the chances of sober
passengers fooling the system by providing samples instead of drivers. Systems are also
being tested that provide passive detection of driver alcohol content. Interlock devices are
often installed in vehicles where drivers have been caught driving with a blood alcohol level
above the legal limit.
A number of evaluations have found that alcohol interlock devices are an effective tool to
prevent drink driving based on re-arrest rates, but these same studies also identify that once
removed, the benefits mostly disappear. Several studies have found that use of interlock
devices have benefits for crash reduction although the exact amount of benefit is difficult to
determine due to small sample sizes.128 129

A.3.13 FATIGUE MONITORING
Fatigue is likely to contribute significantly to the number of fatal and serious injuries. Research
from HICs indicate that more than 20 percent of all crashes are likely to be as a result of
fatigue.130 131 Fatigue can be caused by driving long distances, but can also occur from driving
after insufficient sleep, even after short distances. Effective measures to reduce fatigue are
therefore likely to provide road safety benefits. These include ensuring drivers have adequate
sleep before they drive and providing opportunities to rest along routes.
In-vehicle technologies have also been developed that can detect fatigued drivers from the
driver’s current state and physiological or physical changes (for example, through eye and
eyelid movements, yawning) and/or through driver performance (for example, vehicle lateral
position and driver headway). A variety of technologies show potential in detecting driver
fatigue, but large scale robust evaluations in real-world settings are required to determine
actual crash reductions.
A.3.14 SPEED MONITORING
Speed monitoring systems detect when drivers are traveling above the posted speed limit.
These systems provide feedback to drivers, and may also send alerts back to fleet managers
(in the case of business and commercial drivers) or parents (in the case of novice drivers). In
some cases, devices are fitted that “govern” or limit vehicles so that they can only travel within
the existing speed limit. Trials have also been conducted of recidivist speeders, with
monitoring and alerts provided to enforcement agencies. Speed monitoring devices have been
found to be effective while in use and monitored during short duration trials,132 although the
longer term impacts on safety outcomes are not yet known.
A.3.15 INCREASED SEAT BELT WEARING RATES
See Section A.4.3.
A.3.16 INCREASED HELMET WEARING RATES
The proportion of motorcycle riders tends to be higher in many LMICs compared with HICs,
and this is reflected in crash outcomes. In India, 27 percent of road deaths involve motorized
two-wheelers, while this figure is around 60 percent in Malaysia and up to 90 percent in
Thailand.133 Head injuries are a common cause of fatalities and serious injury among this user
group. Helmets help protect against such injuries and have been shown to produce significant
safety benefits. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that wearing a motorcycle
helmet decreases the risk and severity of injuries by around 70 percent, and decreases the
likelihood of death by up to around 40 percent133 Recent U.S. research also points to the strong
benefits from motorcycle helmet use through the existence and enforcement of helmet laws.134

A.4 SAFE VEHICLES
A.4.1 INTRODUCTION
Vehicle safety improvements have led to significant changes in safety outcomes over the last
few decades. These improvements were initially introduced to passenger vehicles, but are
now migrating to heavy vehicles and even motorcycles. Beneficial vehicle improvements
include active and passive safety devices. Active safety includes those systems that prevent
a crash occurring in the first place, while passive features reduce the level of injury when a
crash occurs. Systems include seat belts, air bags, crumple zones, stability control, and
autonomous emergency braking (preventing rear-end, but also vulnerable road user collision).
All of these features should be encouraged given the safety benefits they produce. This
includes the need to adopt these features in vehicle standards, and in fleet purchasing policy.
Improvements to vehicle safety should form the basis of inspections systems, including for
vehicles in use (private and commercial, and including motorcycles) and for the importation of
new and used vehicles. The public and commercial sectors play an increasingly important role
and can have substantial impacts through vehicle-purchasing specifications.
These individual safety features are captured as part of vehicle star rating (New Car
Assessment Programmes, or NCAP, and used car assessment programs). Vehicles with a
five star rating are the safest, and research has shown that this is reflected in real-world crash
outcomes. A study based on the European NCAP data140 found that 5-star cars had a 25
percent lower chance of fatal or serious injury compared to 2-star cars, while the chance of
death was around 70 percent lower. Similar information from Australia indicates that there is
twice the chance of being killed or seriously injured in a 3-star rated car compared to a 5-star
rated car.
Safety is also a key issue for heavy vehicles, including those carrying freight and passengers.
Additional features may be required for these vehicles, including under-run protection and
blind spot mitigation. As identified above, advanced technologies are now beginning to benefit
not just passenger vehicles, but also heavy vehicles. Maintenance is required to ensure
vehicles remain safe, particularly in LMICs. Enforcement of mass and loading regulations is
also very important. A degree of general deterrence should be created through enforcement
to encourage appropriate loading and operation.

A.4.2 MINIMUM SAFETY STANDARDS
Vehicle design has the potential to decrease the number of crashes and crash severity by
addressing the behavioral and physical limitations of road users and other traffic components.
Vehicle safety involves four broad aspects,2 First, through vehicle control mechanisms such
as braking and steering. Second, innovations like autonomous braking, electronic stability
control, Intelligent Speed Adaptation (ISA) helping the vehicle to avoid crush actively without
driver action. Third, passive protection including seat belts and anchorages, “crumple zones”,
airbags, and pedestrian protection mechanisms which provide better safety to occupants and
pedestrians. Finally, emergency notification systems alert rescue services in case of crash
involvement. “Active” safety technology (AST) generally acts by preventing the crash and
lessening the severity, while “passive” safety technology (PST) reduces the effects of the
crash.141 Failure to maintain these systems may lead to crashes and may also increase the
severity of the crashes and increased fatalities.142 In case of developing countries, minimum
safety requirements are still often overlooked even though the growth of motorization is four
times than in developed countries.143 Unfortunately, in some developing countries vehicles
with the lowest safety standard are the best-sellers in the market.144 It is estimated that vehicle
defects may increase road crashes by up to 50 percent.145 146 147 148
The United Nations (UN) Decade of Action for Road Safety identified that all countries need
to address the minimum arrangements for vehicles, including seat belts and anchorages,
occupant protection in frontal/side/lateral collision, pedestrian protection, and electronic
stability control (ESC).149
A study in Latin America identified that basic improvements in vehicle design could reduce
fatalities by up to around 30 percent.150
A.4.3 SEAT BELTS
Seat belt are one of the most effective safety interventions and can result in significant
numbers of saved lives and reduced injuries if properly installed and used. Seat belts absorb
energy during the crash impact and distribute it, including to stronger body parts of the vehicle
occupants. They restrict users from impacting internal vehicle components, reduce the risk of
being ejected from vehicles, and also reduce the risk of impacts from fellow passengers. Four
types of seat belt are recommended: three-point lap and diagonal seat belt; two-point lap seat
belt; single diagonal belt; and full harness.151 The first two types are used in heavy vehicles
(trucks and buses).

Seat belts reduce fatalities by 40-50 percent in the case of front car seat occupants and 25
percent for those in rear seats.49 In the case of truck drivers, the fatality reduction is 27-77
percent.152 Benefit-cost ratio could be as high as 31.7 for seatbelts.49
For younger children, child seats can be used to provide additional protection. WHO (2009)151
reports significant benefits from use of child restraints, although this varied by type of
installation and age of child. As an example, for a child up to 4 years of age there was a 50
percent lower risk of injury in a forward-facing child restraint, and an 80 percent lower chance
in a rear-facing seat.
The fitting of seat belts and child restraints is obviously very important based on this evidence.
However, it is equally important to ensure the use of these devices. This can be achieved
through laws to make the use of these devices compulsory. It is recommended that any new
law be accompanied by extensive public campaign and awareness programs prior to the
change as well as appropriate levels of enforcement following the passing of the law.151 There
is strong evidence to show that a comprehensive program involving legislative change,
education, and publicity campaigns to raise awareness, and sustained enforcement, produce
significant increases in wearing rates with subsequent safety benefits.151
A.4.4 VEHICLE MAINTENANCE
Research in high income countries suggests that vehicle defects cause only a small proportion
of road crashes (between 3 percent and 5 percent of crashes153). However, in LMICs the
figures are generally much higher because the vehicle fleet is likely to be older, there may be
less stringent vehicle standards, and vehicles may be less well maintained. This is likely for
passenger vehicles as well as heavy vehicles which are used to move freight and passengers.
Estimates are that vehicle defects might be a contributor to up to 50 percent of crashes in
LMICs.154 155 It is therefore expected that systems to improve vehicle maintenance –
particularly in LMICs – will produce road safety benefits. Methods include periodic vehicle
inspection regimes and roadside maintenance checks (noting that these need to be conducted
in a safe manner, preferably in an off-road setting with adequate safety facilities in place,
including for vehicles leaving and entering the roadway). These inspections must be thorough,
and penalties issued for transgressions must be unavoidable. Strong inspection schemes can
lead to a decrease in road crash rates of up to 8 percent in HICs,156 although benefits are
likely to be greater in LMICs given the higher contribution of poorly maintained vehicles to
crashes.
A.4.5 DAYTIME RUNNING LIGHTS FOR CARS AND TRUCKS
Daytime running lights (DRL) start when the engine runs. These have been widely used in
countries where there is less light in daytime especially in winter, but are now increasingly
being used in other locations. DRLs increase the visibility of vehicles during daytime so that
other road users can see the vehicle more easily, resulting in enhanced reaction times. DRLs

consume less energy than normal headlights. DRLs are relatively dim in comparison to
headlights and so should not be used as an alternative to brighten the road ahead at night.
Evidence shows that using DRL may reduce multi-vehicle crashes by a small but significant
amount (around 6 percent).49 Crashes involving vulnerable road users can also be reduced.
Experience from Nordic countries shows that mandatory use of DRL could increase the using
rate up to around 85–90 percent.49
A.4.6 DAYTIME RUNNING LIGHTS FOR TWO- OR THREE-WHEEL VEHICLES
Two- and three-wheelers form a significant proportion of traffic in LMICs. In comparison to
other vehicles such as cars and trucks, they are less visible, especially in heavy and complex
traffic conditions. Also, lack of crash protection and difficulties to detect and assess their
approaching speed make the two-and three-wheelers more crash prone. DRLs are an
effective solution to increase visibility.
A small but significant reduction in crashes (7 percent49) has been reported when using DRLs
by two-wheelers with a positive benefit-cost ratio.
A.4.7 UNDER-RUN GUARDS ON TRUCKS
Under-run guards on trucks or trailers prevents cars or other traffic from falling, sliding, or
driving below the truck or trailer and being run over by the rear wheels (Figure A.22).
Figure A.22: Side under-run guards on truck.
(Source: www.drivingtests.co.nz/resources/what-is-side-underrun-protection-
on-a-truck-or-trailer/)
Due to height and size differences with other traffic, trucks or trailers can cause severe crash
outcomes. To protect more vulnerable road users and reduce damage to immoveable road
side objects, side under-run protection devices (or lateral protection devices) can be helpful.
Similarly, rear under-run protection devices (RUPD) prevent cars and other traffic from similar
damage beneath the rear of trucks. In both cases, this high-strength structure absorbs collision
energy and gives protection to other road users. The surfaces of the protective device should
be smooth and potential overlapping edges should face rearwards or downwards.
48
One estimate suggests that these devices can reduce fatalities by up to 29 percent with a
benefit-cost ratio of 3.9:149.
A.4.8 ELECTRONIC STABILITY CONTROL
Electronic stability control (ESC) is one of the most important vehicle safety innovations,
offering significant safety benefits. ESC is a comprehensive system that detects any loss of
control and applies the needed braking pressure to specific wheels to keep the vehicle on the
intended path. Anti-lock braking systems (ABS) and Traction control are the integral part of
this system.
ESC can reduce fatal crashes by up to 67 percent157 158 and produce up to an 88 percent159
reduction in loss of control situations. Moreover, ABS shows fatality reduction for vulnerable
road users160 including fewer motorcycle deaths (21 percent) and pedestrian deaths (8.5
percent).
A.4.9 ADVANCED VEHICLE TECHNOLOGIES INCLUDING FULLY OR PARTIALLY
AUTOMATED VEHICLES
Vehicle technologies are improving rapidly with a big shift to systems that provide partial
vehicle automation, particularly in HICs. Technologies that allow fully automated control are
also in development. The introduction of these modern technologies will improve safety
through reducing driver-related risk factors. Various levels of automation exist and these are
generally classified in five levels ranging from level zero with no automation to level four where
a vehicle will drive itself without human assistance.161 These technologies may include
advanced crash warning systems, adaptive cruise control (ACC), lane keeping and lane
departure systems, self-parking technology, and other technologies.162
Research suggests that autonomous vehicles (AVs) have the potential to significantly reduce
the number of crashes caused by the drivers through the gradual removal of human control.163
Although estimates vary greatly, at the maximum end of predictions it has been argued that
self-driving cars will reduce 90 percent of crashes because driver error contributes to more
than 90 percent of crashes.164 In a simulation-based study, it was observed that AVs reduce
the number of conflicts by 20 percent to 65 percent for signalized intersections, whereas in
the case of roundabouts, the number of conflicts is reduced by 29 percent to 64 percent.165
There are several major challenges to be addressed in order to achieve these promised levels
of safety, including issues of road user acceptance of technologies, and situations where
vehicle control needs to be passed back quickly to a human operator. Similarly, AV

software/systems can malfunction, with even a single flaw leading to crashes.166 Hence, it is
necessary to better understand the road safety aspects of this technology in different road and
traffic settings. In the meantime, some of these individual emerging technologies are likely to
produce significant safety benefits in the short to medium term. Autonomous driving and some
of the advanced safety features may be quite a way off in some countries, particularly in
LMICs. This is because some of the systems rely on road infrastructure to effectively operate.
For example, lane keeping systems require high quality line markings. It is also likely that
issues such as lower capacity for vehicle inspection and maintenance for these advance
vehicles will inhibit effective uptake of these technologies.

A.5 POST-CRASH CARE
A.5.1 INTRODUCTION
Fatal and serious outcomes are directly related to how injuries resulting from road traffic
crashes are handled immediately after the incident occurs, as well as on-going care and
rehabilitation. Other means for improving the effectiveness of post-crash response care
include the training of first responders (including community members) and emergency
medical services staff, and provision of adequate equipment for emergency response units
and trauma units within hospitals. Training needs to be comprehensive and follow best
practice principles.
A.5.2 SYSTEMS TO IMPROVE EMERGENCY RESPONSE TIME, INCLUDING DEDICATED
PHONE NUMBERS AND LOGISTICAL SUPPORT
Around half of all road traffic deaths occur almost immediately following a crash.167 168 169 170
Poor post-crash care including slow response times means victims may needlessly die at the
scene or during the first few hours following the injury.
A key concept in post-crash care is “the Golden Hour” and the “Platinum 30 Minutes”. These
both highlight the importance of the immediate period following injury where there is the
highest likelihood that prompt medical treatment will prevent death as well as potential for long
term disability. Therefore, providing faster response times for first medical responders will
bring safety benefits. Systems to improve the response time include establishing a national
call number, better logistical coordination of response, and improved telecommunications.171
A.5.3 IMPROVED EMERGENCY RESPONSE CARE
Emergency Medical Service (EMS) systems are vital to reducing fatalities and injury severity.
This begins with the activation of the emergency care systems, and includes care at the scene,
transport, and facility-based emergency care.172 The WHO highlights the need for well-
equipped ambulances with trained staff to assist with uninterrupted transfer of crash victims.173
They also highlight the need for immediate and long-term rehabilitation to limit the impact of
injury.
A systematic review of prehospital trauma systems in developing countries concluded that
proper implementation of prehospital care can reduce fatalities by 25 percent. 174

51
A.5.4 IMPROVED FIRST AID SKILLS FOR THE PUBLIC
Providing first aid training to the community is a useful first step in developing EMS systems
where there is a lack of formal prehospital facilities.175 176 This training increases knowledge,
skills, and willingness to attend to victims as a first responder. If the crash victim receives this
early care in the first few minutes following a crash, fatalities or crash severity can be
reduced.177 178 Experience in LMICs supports this finding.179 180 In addition, training the public
on making emergency calls can be beneficial, with one study identifying a BCR of 19181 from
this initiative.
A.5.5 IMPROVED HOSPITAL CARE
Inadequate trauma care infrastructure has an important detrimental role in death and
disability.182 There is evidence that many crash victims die during treatment due to inadequate
facilities183 184 as well as suboptimal care.185 If patients can be placed at an appropriate trauma
center directly, survival rates are likely to improve.186 A properly equipped trauma care center
with appropriate infrastructure, trained personnel, and adequate equipment and supplies is
vital to increasing the survival of crash victims.187 188 To obtain the best safety outcomes,
health facilities which treat trauma patients should have a dedicated, well equipped accident
and emergency (A&E) unit.185
There is evidence that the treatment of road crash trauma is more effective in a dedicated
trauma center compared with other traditional hospital settings.189 190

3. THE ROAD SAFETY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

KEY MESSAGES
Preventing death and serious injury in road crashes requires a systematic, planned
response, led by an appropriately resourced and accountable governmental leadership.
Countries with the safest road networks have demonstrated political will by targeting
better road safety outcomes, adopting and funding a systematic, evidence-based
approach to intervention, and ensuring key organisational arrangements are in place.
Addressing the Safe System goal means a shift in focus in road safety management from
crash prevention to death and serious injury prevention since all humans make mistakes
and crashes are inevitable.
Intervention to improve speed management, the intrinsic safety of vehicles, the road
environment, and the efficiency of the emergency medical system, all have a major role to
play in addressing this new Safe System focus.
Intervention to improve speed management, the intrinsic safety of vehicles, the road
environment, and the efficiency of the emergency medical system, all have a major role to
play in addressing this new Safe System focus.
Interventions need to be evidence-based, noting that not all interventions offer the same
benefits and while some may be highly effective there are some interventions that may
not be effective at all, or in some cases actually increase risk.
An effective road safety management system covers three linked elements: institutional
management functions, interventions and results. Each element is periodically reviewed
against successful international practice to address challenging and ambitious road safety
goals.
All countries should ensure that an effective road safety management system is in place.
LMICs need to strengthen their road safety management systems to bring challenging
levels of death and serious injuries under control, as do HICs when seeking more
ambitious results.
International ISO standard provides a potentially useful tool for organisations of all sizes in
the development of road safety management systems and for engaging employers in
work-related road safety.
Critical issues are how to build capacity through institutional reforms; how to accelerate
knowledge transfer and learn from previous experience; how to increase investment; and
how to increase international cooperation and development aid support (for LMICs)
sustainability.
Essential road safety management tools are available to help jurisdictions and
organisations as well as international aid agencies in building capacity. International
professional networks play a key role in helping to build knowledge and assist
implementation.
A practical two-step process is outlined in national guidance for countries wishing to
improve their results. This starts with a road safety management capacity review and the
specification of an investment strategy leading to Safe System project design and
implementation.

To produce rapid results, road safety programmes and projects must initially target high
concentrations of crash deaths and serious injuries on sections and areas of the road
network where the biggest gains can be made.

3.1 INTRODUCTION
Road safety management is the first and fundamental pillar of the Decade of Action’s Global Plan for
2021-2030 (WHO, 2021) and the Global Status Report on Road Safety (WHO, 2023). The Decade of Action
and the Global Plan emphasise that improving road safety performance requires a systematic and planned
approach.

Establishing an effective road safety management system is the means by which countries and
organisations can achieve this.

This chapter serves as a brief introduction to the key elements of effective road safety management
system frameworks and new tools. The aim is to outline the general scope of understanding of the road
safety management task to provide background and context for more specific guidance that follows
throughout this manual.

The chapter highlights the importance of institutional management at all levels to provide the foundation
for successful road safety intervention and sustainable results. It emphasises the overarching importance
of governmental leadership at the country level and top management leadership of road safety in
organisations. New tools are presented which are designed to help countries and organisations develop or
improve their road safety management systems. Practical next steps which countries can take towards
these ends are briefly outlined and are developed further in subsequent chapters.

HOW DO I GET STARTED?
LMICs need to work actively to establish and develop their road safety management systems to
address challenging road safety problems in a systematic way.

All countries need to review their performance and benchmark it against effective practice before
developing new road safety strategies and plans and projects.

All countries should consider adopting the long-term Safe System goal, set interim targets (initially at
project level for LMICs) and move to implement effective measures towards its delivery for example,
using funded demonstration projects to build new capacity. All countries should target high
concentrations of fatal and serious injuries on sections and areas of the road network where the
biggest gains can be made.

New review tools, international professional networks and international development aid can help
LMICs get started. Technical assistance in crash database development, infrastructure safety
improvements, and general deterrence-based road safety enforcement programmes can be provided
by the International Road Traffic Accident Database Group (IRTAD), the International Road
Assessment Programme (iRAP), and the International Road Policing Organization (RoadPOL),
respectively.

3.2 MANAGEMENT SYSTEM FRAMEWORKS AND
TOOLS
This section presents a brief summary of road safety management system frameworks and related tools
for jurisdictions and organisations. The user of this manual is encouraged to consult original sources and
the links to detailed information about road safety management frameworks, tools and their use, which are
provided throughout the section.

Countries with the safest road networks demonstrate many common characteristics in their management
of road safety. They have targeted better safety outcomes, adopted a systematic approach to intervention,
and put in place a range of institutional arrangements which have been built up over many years (ITF,
2008; Bliss & Breen, 2009, 2013).

For more information:

On institutional arrangements: ITF, 2008 and Bliss & Breen, 2009 (updated in 2013)
On leadership, Safe System management and governance: ITF, 2016
On successful practice integrated into management tools for countries and jurisdictions: Bliss &
Breen, 2009 (updated in 2013)
On road traffic safety management system elements for organisations (ISO 39001 – see ISO,
2012)

These tools are designed to assist decision-makers and practitioners anywhere in the world in developing
sustainable management systems. They outline pragmatic steps to build initial capacity to achieve road
safety results. These tools are designed to be mutually reinforcing. They provide guidance on accountable,
results-focused institutional management; promote the adoption of the Safe System goal and approach
with interim targets and encourage implementation of demonstrably effective interventions to address
known risk factors associated with death and serious injury in road crashes.

The main focus of this section is the country or jurisdictional road safety management system. However, a
brief outline of the international standard for organisations is also given.

COUNTRY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM FRAMEWORK
A road safety management assessment framework has been developed based on effective practice which
identifies those elements of management that are crucial to improving country/jurisdictional road safety
performance (Bliss & Breen, 2009, 2013). Safety is produced just like other goods and services and the
production process in the framework illustrated in Figure 3.1, is viewed as a management system with
three levels: institutional management functions produce interventions, which in turn produce desired
results.

FIGURE 3.1: THE ROAD SAFETY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (SOURCE: BLISS & BREEN, 2009)



The following sections provide a brief description of the three management system elements shown in
Figure 3.1.

INSTITUTIONAL MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS
The foundation of an effective country road safety management system is institutional management, as
indicated in the bottom level of the pyramid shown above. Key elements of effective institutional
management have been identified and defined through global study of management systems and
leadership arrangements in countries and jurisdictions that have achieved substantial reductions in deaths
and serious injuries (as well as those in countries without such arrangements and which have been less
effective) (ITF, 2008; Bliss & Breen, 2009, 2013; GRSF 2006-13; ITF 2016). These are outlined in Box 3.1.

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 8/132




BOX 3.1: INSTITUTIONAL MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS

Results focus is the overarching institutional management function. Doing so provides a
strategic orientation that links all actual and potential interventions with results, analyses
what can be achieved over time, and sets out a performance management framework for
the delivery of interventions and their intermediate and final outcomes. It defines the level of
safety performance that a country intends to achieve expressed in terms of vision, goals,
objectives and related targets.
Coordination concerns the development and alignment of the interventions and other
related institutional management functions delivered by government partners and related
community and business partnerships to achieve the desired focus on results.
Legislation (where necessary) concerns the appropriate legal instruments to specify the
legitimate bounds of institutions, their responsibilities and accountabilities, their
interventions and their related institutional management functions to achieve the desired
focus on results.
Funding and resource allocation concerns the financing of interventions and related
institutional management functions on a sustainable basis using a rational evaluation and
programming framework to allocate resources to achieve the desired focus on results.
Promotion concerns the countrywide and sustained communication of road safety as a core
business for Government and society, emphasising the shared societal responsibility to
support the delivery of the interventions required to achieve the desired results.
Monitoring, analysis and evaluation concerns the systematic and ongoing
measurement, analysis and evaluation of interventions in terms of achieving the desired
road safety outputs and outcomes (results).
Research and development and knowledge transfer concerns the systematic and
ongoing creation, codification, transfer and application of knowledge that contributes to the
improved efficiency and effectiveness of the road safety management system to achieve the
desired focus on results.

Source: Bliss & Breen, 2009

The overarching function and the rationale for the management system is to reduce crashes leading to
fatal and serious injuries (results focus). This represents the expression of a country or jurisdiction’s desire
to achieve better road safety results through performance review; analysis of the scope for crash reduction
efforts, setting long-term goals and interim targets for road safety strategies, programmes and projects
and providing the means and accountabilities needed to achieve them. The delivery of this function is
discussed fully in Chapter 6. Road Safety Targets, Investment Strategies Plans and Projects. Supporting
this key function are defined arrangements and capacity for coordination, legislation, funding and resource
allocation, promotion, monitoring, analysis and evaluation, research and innovation, knowledge
development and transfer. In the absence of a clear and accountable focus on fatal and serious crash
reduction, all other institutional management functions and interventions lack cohesion and direction, and
the efficiency and effectiveness of safety initiatives can be undermined (Bliss & Breen, 2009, 2013). For
these reasons and as advised in Chapter 6. Road Safety Targets, Investment Strategies Plans and Projects,
LMICs should exercise caution in establishing complex targeted strategies and plans until data and
appropriate management capacity are available. However, measurement of safety performance and
targeting specific results is recommended in funded, ‘learning by doing’ demonstration corridor/area

projects.

Institutional management functions are delivered primarily by the government agencies with core road
safety responsibilities – e.g. transport, land-use planning, roads, justice, police, health, occupational health
and safety and education. They are also delivered in government partnerships with civil society and
business, in alignment with country and organisational goals and targets. The professional and research
community provide key support for demonstrably effective next steps. As highlighted previously,
governmental leadership and the setting up of a governmental lead agency are prerequisites for
successful activity (Peden et al., 2004; OECD, 2008, GRSF, 2009, 2013).

Institutional management functions and examples of their delivery are referred to throughout this manual.
A range of in-depth case studies which illustrate successful country delivery can be found in Annex 2 and
Annex 4 of the road safety management guidelines produced and used by the World Bank (Bliss & Breen,
2009). Chapter 6. Road Safety Targets, Investment Strategies Plans and Projects as well as Annex 3 and
Annex 4 of global road safety management guidance (Bliss & Breen, 2009, 2013) provide guidance on
establishing or strengthening lead agency arrangements.

INTERVENTIONS
The second element of the road safety management system framework outlined in Figure 3.1 is system-
wide intervention. Effective intervention focuses on the implementation of evidence-based approaches to
reduce exposure to the risk of death and serious injury; to prevent death and serious injury; to mitigate the
severity of injury when a crash occurs, and to reduce the consequences of injury. Interventions need to
address the safety of all users and take future demographics into account, notably the physical
vulnerability of very young and of the ageing society.

A common misperception in countries getting started in road safety is to assume that since 90% of crashes
may be due to human error, then direct approaches relying heavily upon education and training play a
substantial part in saving lives and preventing serious injuries. Although these measures play a supportive
role, there is little evidence to confirm that education and training, alone, will achieve road safety results.
Speed management, the safety engineering of vehicles and roads and improvements in the emergency
medical system response are observed to play the major role (Peden et al., 2004). At the same time, the
Safe System goal requires the examination of contributory factors in road safety engineering and other
interventions to shift from a focus on crash prevention to a focus on death and serious injury prevention.
Again, research on contributory factors to deaths and serious injuries indicates that intervention to
improve speed management and the intrinsic safety of vehicles and the road environment all have a major
role to play in addressing this new focus (Stigson et al., 2011).

The Global Road Safety Facility (GRSF) has developed an evidence-based guide on ‘what works and what
does not work’ when selecting and applying road safety interventions that are effective in reducing fatal
and serious injuries (Turner et al., 2021). The guide highlights that not all road safety interventions are
equally effective and that what appear to be ‘common-sense’ interventions will often not be the best, and
in some cases may have very limited or even negative impacts, despite being commonly - and mistakenly
recommended or accepted. The guide sets out evidence and presents case studies on interventions within
a Safe System context and with a focus on LMICs, although the information presented is of relevance to all
countries.

Better performing countries implement integrated packages of road safety interventions that have
demonstrated significant performance gains as well as implementing innovation based on established

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 10/132



safety principles. The findings of the World Report on Road Traffic Injury Prevention provide a substantial
consensus-based blueprint for country, regional and global action, and have subsequently been endorsed
by successive United Nations General Assembly resolutions (Peden et al., 2004). Reports by the OECD, ITF
and World Bank (e.g., ITF, 2008; ITF, 2016; Turner et al., 2021) also provide international reviews on the
effectiveness of interventions. Information is also available from the SUNflower study (Koornstra et al.,
2002), the European Road Safety Observatory (2014) and guidance produced by the UNRSC (2006-13).

Key recommended intervention strategies include:

Safety conscious planning and proactive safety engineering design.
Encouraging use of safer modes of transport and safer routes.
Safe separation/safe integration of mixed road use.
Managing speeds to crash protection levels.
Providing crash protective roadsides and vehicles.
Deterring dangerous behaviour and ensuring compliance with key safety rules by social
marketing and increased highly visible police enforcement using camera technologies and other
means, by providing proven driver assistance safety technologies in vehicles to help drivers
keep to speed limits, wear seat belts, or avoid excess alcohol.
Managing risk via vehicle standards/designs and driver standards e.g. graduated driver
licensing.
Fast and efficient emergency medical help, diagnosis and care.

Examples of highly effective road safety interventions within a Safe System context are highlighted in Box
3.2.

BOX 3.2: EXAMPLES OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE ROAD SAFETY INTERVENTIONS

When used in combination (particularly across different parts of the Safe System), effective
interventions can produce significant road safety outcomes. Some road safety interventions are highly
effective, with up to a 70 or 80 percent reduction in fatalities and severe injuries (for example, safety
barriers and roundabouts). Equally, it is important to recognise that some interventions often promoted
or recommended may not be effective, and in the worst cases may actually increase risk.

Whilst not an exhaustive list, examples of highly effective interventions (defined as those producing
crash reduction benefits of 30 percent or more) are highlighted in the following table:

HIGHLY EFFECTIVE COUNTERMEASURES

Source: Turner et. al., 2021

This manual is intended to provide clear and accessible information on the effective management of road
safety infrastructure with a focus on the selection and application of road infrastructure interventions. To
produce rapid results, road safety programmes must initially target high concentrations of crash deaths
and serious injuries on sections of the road network where the biggest gains can be made.

The planning, design, operation and use of the road network is generally called road infrastructure safety
management (RISM) as described in the European Directive 2008/96/EC (and as outlined in Part 3 of this
manual). The products and services used within RISM address the conditions under which vehicles and
road users can safely use the road network combined with the safe recovery and rehabilitation of crash
victims. In all these areas, specific standards, rules, guidelines, policies and protocols are set with
compliance and oversight mechanisms in place.

This manual does not set out to provide detailed guidance on road safety intervention in general but
relates specifically to the planning, design, operation and use of the road network within the context of the

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 12/132



RISM process. See Part 3, Chapter 9. Infrastructure Safety Management and Chapter 10. Risk and Issue
Identification for information on the RISM process including approaches to infrastructure safety
management and assessing road network risks, respectively. Then, see Chapter 11. Intervention Selection
and Prioritisation for guidance on intervention selection and prioritisation to address these risks. Here,
cross references are also made to key work carried out by PIARC which includes its recent work and
guidance on road hierarchies which provide a fundamental framework for safety management of the road
network.

RESULTS (OUTCOMES AND OUTPUTS)
The final element of the road safety management system shown in Figure 3.1 concerns the measurement
of results and their expression as targets in terms of final outcomes, intermediate outcomes, and outputs
(Bliss, 2004). Targets define the desired safety performance endorsed by government at all levels,
stakeholders and the community. The level of safety is ultimately determined by the quality of
interventions that have been implemented, which in turn are determined by the quality of the country’s
delivery of institutional management functions. The GSRF highlighted a few examples of success in the
booklet ‘Leveraging Global Road Safety Success’ (GSRF/World Bank, 2020).

Final outcomes can be expressed as a long-term goal for the future safety of the road traffic system (e.g.
as in Safe System, Vision Zero) and interim, short- to medium-term targets towards this expressed in
terms of social costs, fatalities and serious injuries usually presented in absolute terms. They can also be
measured and targeted in terms of rates per capita, vehicle, and volume of travel. See ITF (2023) for
further discussion.

Intermediate outcomes are linked to improvements in the final outcomes and typical measures include
average traffic speeds, the proportion of drunk drivers in fatal and serious injury crashes, seatbelt-wearing
rates, helmet-wearing rates, the physical condition or safety rating of the road network (e.g. iRAP ratings),
the standard or safety rating of the vehicle fleet (e.g. Global NCAP ratings), and emergency medical
system response. See ITF (2016) for further discussion on intermediate safety performance indicators.

Outputs represent physical deliverables that underpin improvements in intermediate and final outcomes.
Examples are kilometres of safety engineering improvements implemented and the number of police
enforcement operations required to reduce average traffic speeds, increase seatbelt use or reduce
drinking and driving. They can also correspond to milestones showing a specific task has been completed
(Bliss, 2004).

Countries active in road safety are increasingly setting measurable final outcome and intermediate
outcome targets. In some cases, they also set related measurable output targets in line with the targeted
outcomes. As mentioned previously, in many LMICs, where capacity to implement national targeted plans
is non-existent or in a fledgling state, countries are advised to adopt the long-term Safe System goal but to
restrict the setting of quantitative targets to funded corridor and area demonstration projects. Chapter 6.
Road Safety Targets, Investment Strategies, Plans and Projects provides guidance on road data systems,
which allow the setting and monitoring of targets. Case studies are presented in Chapter 7. Roles,
Responsibilities, Policy Development and Programmes of target-setting in different contexts. See Part 3
Chapter 12 for guidance on Monitoring, Analysis and Evaluation of Road Safety Interventions .

All three elements of the road safety management system – institutional management functions,
interventions and results – need to be benchmarked against identified effective practice as countries
develop new projects, programmes and strategies, regardless of their stage of development (ITF, 2008).

The following section Country Management System Tool outlines recommended steps and available tools
to assess the strengths and weaknesses of country road safety management and to implement necessary
capacity building initiatives.

COUNTRY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM TOOL
Guidance has been published by the World Bank to assist countries which want to improve their road
safety outcomes (Bliss & Breen, 2009, 2013). These acknowledge that building effective capacity requires
long- term investment and will not be achieved overnight. These address the central issue of how to shift
from weaker to stronger institutional management to make this happen. The guidance outlines two
practical steps to strengthen country road safety management. The first step, noted below, comprises a
road safety management capacity review which helps to identify strengths and weaknesses in current
approaches.

STEP 1: CONDUCT CAPACITY REVIEW AND SPECIFY INVESTMENT STRATEGY PROJECTS

The recommended first step for countries is to carry out a road safety management capacity review. Road
safety management capacity review has been independently evaluated as a cost effective, good practice
tool that has been used widely in LMICs. It has also been used in Sweden and Western Australia where it
has contributed to strengthening in some aspects of institutional delivery to good effect (GRSF, 2012).

Capacity review objectives: The aims of the capacity review are to:

Set out an integrated, multi sectoral framework for dialogue with country partners and
stakeholders on potential road safety investments.
Assess government ownership of safety results and identify related institutional responsibilities
and accountabilities.
Reach official consensus on road safety management capacity weaknesses and institutional
strengthening and determine investment priorities to overcome them.
Identify Safe System implementation projects to launch the investment strategy (Bliss & Breen,
2009).

Road safety management capacity review involves engagement with senior management in key
government agencies and the private sector who are able to influence country results. The review is
conducted by experienced, internationally recognised, external road safety specialists with senior
management experience at country and international levels.

Capacity review steps: A country capacity review is conducted through nine distinctive steps:

1. Set review objectives.
2. Prepare for review.
3. Appraise results with a focus at the system level.
4. Appraise results with a focus at the interventions level.
5. Appraise results with a focus at the institutional management functions level.
6. Assess lead agency role and identify capacity strengthening priorities.
7. Specify investment strategy and identify Safe System implementation projects.
8. Confirm review findings at high-level workshop.
9. Finalise review report (Bliss & Breen, 2009).

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 14/132



Twelve checklists are used to help assess and benchmark all elements of the management system and
their linkages according to effective practice (Bliss & Breen, 2009, 2013).

Long-term investment strategy: On the basis of the review, a long-term investment strategy is
developed which lays a pathway from weak to strong capacity via establishment, growth and consolidation
phases of the investment strategy. These phases are discussed fully in Chapter 6. Targets and Strategic
Plans.

The first stepping stone for many LMICs in establishing their road safety activity will be to prepare road
safety projects rather than embark initially on the ambitious national road safety plans foreseen in the
growth phase. Road safety management capacity reviews indicate that LMICs that specify national plans
without the funded capacity to achieve them are unsuccessful (GRSF, 2006-13).

The project involves building core institutional capacity to measure and target safety outcomes in high-
volume, high-risk corridors and areas, with specific attention being paid simultaneously to lead agency and
related coordination arrangements and monitoring and evaluation. This provides a basis for the scaling up
of investment to accelerate this capacity strengthening, and the achievement of improved results across
the road network in a national plan for the growth phase.

STEP 2: IMPLEMENT SAFE SYSTEM PROJECTS TO LAUNCH INVESTMENT STRATEGY

The second step of the country guidance is the careful preparation and implementation of Safe System
road safety projects to deliver the establishment phase of the investment strategy (Bliss & Breen, 2009,
2013). As mentioned previously, carefully prepared and funded demonstration corridor projects provide an
excellent means for countries starting out in road safety or countries embarking on more ambitious
approaches to build initial capacity.

Current World Bank road safety investment in capacity building efforts is focusing on systematic,
measurable and accountable investment programmes. These simultaneously advance the transfer of road
safety knowledge, strengthen the capacity of participating governmental partners and stakeholders, and
rapidly produce results in targeted high-risk corridors and areas. The aim is to provide benchmarks,
dimensions and capacity for the next stage of investment (Bliss & Breen, 2013). Recommended project
components are briefly outlined in the ‘Getting Started’ material at the end of this chapter, while examples
are provided in Chapter 7. Roles, Responsibilities, Policy Development and Programmes . Complementary
guidance has been issued for a streamlined approach to capacity review and project development and
‘mainstreaming’ road safety in regional trade road corridors (Bliss & Breen, 2013; Breen et al., 2013).

While the two-step process outlined above has been identified to inform investment priorities in LMICs, the
above tools have also been used by HICs which have moved to a Safe System approach (Breen et al.,
2008; Howard et al., 2010). Chapter 7. Roles, Responsibilities, Policy Development and Programmes
provides examples of capacity building demonstration projects that can help build leadership and
coordination arrangements, implement multi-sectoral action, and achieve quick results in targeted high-
volume, high- risk corridors and areas.

This section has briefly introduced capacity building tools. The main principles which underpin this
guidance can be summarised as: the need to address all elements of the road safety management system
in reviewing management capacity to produce results; adoption of a phased approach to road safety
investment and a ‘learning by doing’ approach; targeting the highest concentrations of deaths and serious
injuries across the road network and adopting a Safe System approach; and building global, regional and
country road safety management capacity. Practical examples of how these tools are being used

worldwide are presented throughout this manual. Readers are referred to the original guidance for a
detailed discussion (Bliss & Breen, 2009, 2013).

ISO 39001 FOR ORGANISATIONS
Motor vehicle crashes are a leading cause of death and long-term injury at work and in driving associated
with work. For example, surveys in several EU countries indicate that between 40-60% of all work
accidents resulting in death are road crashes. Studies conducted across the world indicate that the costs of
work-related crashes are substantial, both for society and employers (DaCoTA, 2012). To reduce death and
serious injury the International Standards Organization developed the standard ISO 39001 ‘Road Traffic
Safety Management Systems’.

The standard is designed to assist organisations in integrating road safety as a core objective into their
management systems, as well as aligning with country road safety goals and strategies. The standard is
aimed at both small and large organisations, as well as the public and private sector Specific examples
given include organisations concerned with transporting goods and people; those generating traffic, such
as schools and supermarkets; and those responsible for provision of the road network.

The ISO 39001 standard links to other ISO management systems standards and sets out specific and wide-
ranging top management responsibilities and key management functions. ISO 39001 requires
organisations to adopt the Safe System goal and to make decisions on objectives and targets for the
interim as well as plans to achieve them. The organisation is required to follow a process that starts with a
review of its current road traffic safety performance; makes an assessment of the context for the
organisation’s activity; and considers specified, measurable road traffic safety performance factors known
to reduce the risk of fatal and serious injury within the organisation's sphere of influence. The organisation
has to select the road traffic safety performance factors to work on and then analyse what it can achieve
over time. When establishing its targets, the organisation is required to consider the management capacity
required to achieve them, as well as monitoring results and reviewing its road safety management system
towards continual improvement (ISO, 2012).

Early adopters of ISO 39001 include freight and passenger transport organisations and companies in
Sweden and Japan. If implemented within the national policy framework, the tool has high potential to
engage employers of organisations of all sizes in effective road safety activity. In the case of LMICs, early
adoption of ISO 39001 by large corporations in the first instance could assist governments in meeting their
serious road safety challenges.

PLANNING AND SAFETY MANAGEMENT
When the main objective is to avoid crashes on the roads, all levels of society need to contribute. At the
highest level, the way in which society decides on its transport needs, the choice of transport and mobility,
the level of provided transport equipment and facilities, the level of education of road users, etc., are all
influenced. All these factors, which are controlled at the national and to some extent global level, are also
of great importance for the level of road safety at the local level. However, they cannot be directly
influenced by individual municipalities.

At a lower level, road safety is also the result of practical planning, in other words, where activities are
located and how the transport system is structured. For example, the road and street system can be
divided into different categories according to the activities and potential disturbances. A certain level of
traffic safety required by one group of road users often contrasts with the level of safety desire by another.

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 16/132



How different modes of transport look and how conflicts between them are prioritised is very important in
determining the risks to which different groups of transport users are exposed. Longer journeys expose
more people to more risks and generally lead to more crashes. Municipalities have the opportunity to
influence this through sound planning. It is also needed to create good operating conditions for public
transport which reduces crash exposure through the reduction of vehicle volumes.

Road safety can be examined in more detail by looking at the behaviour of road users and how they use
and take or reduce risk behaviours on the transport system. The transport environment places demands
on the behaviour of road users, and the capacity of road users places demands on the design of the
surrounding environment as it interacts with road users and how road users interact with each other can
help to understand the causes of individual crashes. It is the responsibility of the municipal system and to
maintain the quality level. In this respect local influence is strong.

The design and planning of the municipal transport system therefore directly affects future road safety,
but it is important to understand that municipal planning also affects the level of road safety in the
municipality well into the future. This is why road safety must be integrated into all planning of the
physical environment.

In the context of extended social planning, road safety is one of many factors influencing other aspects.
Other aspects also influence road safety. Balanced weighting between different attributes such as urban
character, accessibility, safety, road safety and environmental impact will ensure a sustainable outcome in
the long term. Features can work for or against each other and can also compete for available resources.
Therefore, municipalities need to make their own priorities and adjust their investments according to their
needs and resources.

Road safety affects urban space and urban life appropriate speed and well-designed urban space have
synergetic effects. Road Safety can act as a catalyst for creating a more beautiful urban space and a safer
more vibrant city. Improved road safety can also have positive effects on noise and air quality. More
moderate speeds reduce emissions and noise. Lower speeds also reduce the attractiveness of car traffic,
which reduces the flow car traffic to some extent.

Success in local road safety work requires the creation of structures and the acquisition of information
involving several municipal functions. Different measures need to be prioritised and the most cost-
effective ones selected for implementation Section 11.4. Intervention and Prioritisation . There is a need to
create continuity in the work and for municipal officials, politicians and, above all, the general public to
learn to understand the problems better. To this end, a road safety programme must be drawn up,
documenting the objectives and the efforts to be made, and to which a commitment must be made, and to
which a commitment must be made. It will be easy to monitor progress (see Chapter 12. Monitoring and
Evaluation ) and new programmes can be drawn up at the end of the programme period. A systematic
approach is the basis not only for success but also for increasing knowledge in society a. A systematic
approach requires clear objectives, knowledge of the current situation and a clear understanding of how to
achieve them.

3.3 PATHWAY TO IMPROVING ROAD SAFETY
MANAGEMENT

GETTING STARTED
International organisations recommend that all countries and organisations should
consider adopting the long-term Safe System goal as the focus of their road safety
management system.
The recommended first step before establishing a road safety investment strategy for
countries at any stage of development is to commission a capacity review to be carried
out by senior independent road safety experts. This review assesses all elements of the
road safety management system and its linkages; sets out the strategic lines of a road
safety management investment strategy; and broadly identifies Safe System projects to
launch it.
The recommended second step to building the capacity identified by a review is the
careful design and implementation of multi-sectoral funded Safe System projects. The aim
is to ‘learn by doing’. The recommended approach is to simultaneously advance the
transfer of road safety knowledge, strengthen the capacity of participating governmental
partners and stakeholders, and rapidly produce results in targeted high-volume, high-risk
corridors and areas to provide the dimensions for the next stage of investment.
Key project components recommended in country guidance include:

Capacity strengthening priorities: lead agency establishment/development,
crash database development and other institutional reforms.
High-risk corridors and areas to be targeted with good practice interventions:
infrastructure safety improvements; general deterrence-based traffic safety
enforcement programmes, supported by intensive publicity and awareness
campaigns (e.g. speed, alcohol, seatbelts and helmets, fatigue, commercial
vehicles); and improved post-crash response and emergency medical and
rehabilitation services.
Reviews of policy reforms: e.g. driver licensing, vehicle safety standards.
Project management arrangements: lead agency role, coordination.
Monitoring, analysis and evaluation: survey measurement (e.g. safety
behaviours such as mean speed, drinking and driving, use of protective
equipment); vehicle and road network safety quality; and efficiency of
emergency medical response); performance targets for high-risk corridors and
areas; procedures; and reporting arrangements; the development of a crash
database and analysis system.

MAKING PROGRESS

A scaling-up of investment is recommended after initial basic capacity has been built to include
leadership, multi-sectoral working, and monitoring, analysis and evaluation. Based on what has been
achieved in the targeted corridors and areas and policy reviews, this growth phase involves:

Setting quantitative national targets.

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 18/132



Rolling-out comprehensive multi-sectoral measures across high fatal and serious crash-
density corridors and urban areas of the total road network.
Implementing ongoing reforms of safety policies and interventions, and introducing new
measures in accordance with effective international practice.
Strengthening and refocusing lead agency role and functions and related coordination
arrangements.
Managing, monitoring, analysing and evaluating road safety results across high fatal and
serious crash density corridors and urban areas of the total road network.
Implementing ongoing reforms of institutional management functions.
Disseminating safety performance data from the national crash analysis system and
ensuring open access to the system by all partners and stakeholders.

CONSOLIDATING ACTIVITY

As capacity is steadily built, national activity undergoes periodic review and continual refinement and
is expanded to include a safety performance framework for regions, provinces and districts. This
involves:

Extending national targets and also applying these to regions, provinces and districts.
Sustaining comprehensive multi-sectoral measures across the total road network and
extending targeting to less risky roads.
Reviewing and internationally benchmarking safety policies and interventions, and
implementing reforms.
Reviewing and reforming lead agency role and functions and related coordination
arrangements.
Extending performance monitoring, analysis and evaluation of safety results to less risky
roads in the network.
Reviewing and reforming institutional management functions.
Upgrading national crash analysis system and extending performance monitoring
capabilities.

4. THE SAFE SYSTEM APPROACH

KEY MESSAGES
The Safe System approach is the most effective way of considering and responding to
fatal and serious casualty crash risks on a network.
This approach is based on an ethical position where it can never be acceptable that people
are seriously injured or killed on the network. It provides a set of design and operating
principles to guide action on the journey to the long-term elimination goal.
The long-term Safe System goal is the elimination of death and serious injuries on a
country’s roads.
The Safe System is being adopted by an increasing number of countries and forms the
basis for the UN Decade of Action for Road Safety.
The Safe System requires strong governmental leadership, as well as the engagement of a
wide range of sectors.
The prime responsibility of a road authority and other agencies is to support road users to
reach the end of their trips safely.
The Safe System approach compels system designers to provide a safe environment, and
to consider the combined system as the major factor in crashes rather than the traditional
approach that placed most responsibility for safety on the road user.
A focus on key crash types occurring on a network helps to identify the role and
intervention options for each Safe System element.
System-wide intervention strategies are required to avoid fatal and serious injury crash
outcomes, including emergency medical care for crash victims.
There is a shared responsibility between system designers (who design and operate the
roads) and road users, for safe travel outcomes on the road network.
The Safe System approach compels system designers to provide an safe environment, and
to consider the combined system as the major factor in crashes rather than the traditional
approach that placed most responsibility for safety on the road user.
The system design and operation must become forgiving of routine human (road user)
error.
The Safe System framework developed by ITF - World Bank provides a mechanism to help
identify the current level of Safe System progress, which can be applied to a project,
region, country, or organisation, as well as to interventions and activities.

4.1 INTRODUCTION
This chapter outlines the Safe System approach from first principles to end delivery of safe outcomes, with
cross-referencing to the detailed planning and design activities that give effect to a Safe System approach,
which are set out in later sections of this manual.

A Safe System approach within the road transport system is built around the premise that death and injury
are unacceptable and are avoidable. This approach seeks to ensure that no road user is subject to kinetic
energy exchange in a crash which will result in death or serious long-term disabling injury. OECD (ITF,
2016) endorses the Safe System approach and notes that Safe System principles represent a fundamental
shift from traditional road safety thinking, reframing the way in which traffic safety is viewed and
managed.

The Safe System represents a major change to past approaches. It overturns the fatalistic view that road
traffic injury is the price to be paid for achieving mobility. It sets a goal of eliminating road crash fatalities
and serious injuries in the long-term, with interim targets to be set in the years towards road death and
serious injury elimination.

This elimination is feasible. It requires system reconfiguration and recognition that the network must
eventually be forgiving of routine human (road user) errors. It is important to recognise the fundamental
change that road safety agencies, including road authorities, will face in embracing and implementing this
Safe System aspiration and in implementing Safe System treatments across their networks (See Chapter 7.
Roles, Responsibilities, Policy Development and Programmes ).

ITF (2016) suggests that the key Safe System principles are as follows:

1. People make mistakes that can lead to road crashes.
2. The human body has a limited physical ability to tolerate crash forces before harm occurs.
3. A shared responsibility exists amongst those who design, build, manage and use roads and vehicles

and provide post-crash care to prevent crashes resulting in serious injury or death.
4. All parts of the system must be strengthened to multiply their effects; and if one part fails, road

users are still protected.

The key elements and principles of the Safe System approach are shown in Figure 4.1.

HOW DO I GET STARTED?
A commitment is needed from agencies to review their road safety capacity (see Chapter 3. Road
Safety Management System ); to develop understanding of the principles of Safe System and its
elements; to adopt a long-term goal for elimination of fatalities and serious injuries.

Countries must develop their knowledge to address gaps within the agencies (and of other
stakeholders) as to what a Safe System approach is and what practical change this will require in
management and intervention approaches. Over time all Safe System elements (See Section 4.7.
Safe System Elements & Application ), and the safety of all road users are to be addressed. Funding
needs are to be identified and advocated to government.

Understanding of major crash types (see Section 4.4. Reassessing Crash Causation Factors and Crash
Types ) should be determined from crash data or, if not available, from discussions with police and
emergency services workers. Develop a reliable crash data system as soon as possible (see Chapter
5. Effective Management and Use of Safety Data ).

Road assessment programmes can play a part in identifying higher risk sections of a network and in
identifying affordable treatments, especially where reliable crash injury data is not available.

Weaknesses in Safe System elements (roads and traffic management - including roadside
management and adjacent development access controls, see Section 7.3. Impacts of Safe System
Adoption on Roles and Responsibilities of a Road Authority ; vehicles, speeds; and road user
behaviours) which contribute to fatalities and serious injuries in these crash types should be
determined.

In the short term, for new road projects, adoption of Safe System design policies which apply Safe
System principles to treatments to reduce fatal crash risk will be developed. Design guidelines would
follow subsequently but these would be a substantial development task which requires an
incremental medium-term approach.

Seek to improve user behaviour and compliance (see Section 4.6. Safe System – Scientific Safety
Principles and Their Application ) across the whole existing network through improved traffic
management guidance, reduced speed limits in high-risk areas and improved police enforcement,
offence penalties and public education (see Chapter 6. Road Safety Targets, Investment Strategies,
Plans and Projects for the recommended demonstration project approach).

In the medium to longer term: Carry out progressive retrofitting of the existing system. Do what is
feasible to improve infrastructure safety and further improve behaviour and compliance through
licensing system reviews and legislative changes regarding offences. Continue public education
campaigns and seek improved vehicle safety regulation and public education.

4.2 SAFETY AND THE CURRENT TRANSPORT
SYSTEM
The Safe System approach is a comprehensive safety philosophy, developed and internationally agreed
upon to form the foundation for safe design and operation of the road transport system. The deficiencies in
traditional approaches to achieving a safe road network were highlighted by Tingvall (2005). He noted that
the road transport system is traditionally characterised as follows:

An open system with a large number of stakeholders loosely connected to each other.
Societies not having a clear and shared idea of how the system should develop in safety terms,
with individual countermeasures implemented on an ad hoc basis in isolation from each other.
Components not operating in alignment, with large parts of the system not tolerating speeds
higher than 50 or 60 km/h, road users allowed to drive at 100 km/h, and modern vehicles
having the capacity to travel readily at 200 km/h. This substantial mismatch is a key factor
explaining current inadequate safety levels.
Lack of acceptance of responsibility by stakeholders. While individual users have a clear legal
responsibility, other important providers/operators of the system often do not.
The legal and moral blame in crashes is placed most often on the road user.
Measures to prevent crashes and injuries have had the individual user as the main target. To do
so with a high-energy system where large gaps exist between human capability and the
requirements necessary to travel safely within the system, is an indicator of a lack of
acceptance of responsibility from the providers of the system.
There has not been adequate guidance developed for the system providers and operators to do
what is necessary.
There has not been an agreed definition of what a safe road transport system is, only what is
safer.

These comments draw attention to the fact that there has been a lack of acceptance of responsibility in
this field by most governments. The safest communities (ITF, 2016) will be those that embrace the shift
towards a Safe System and begin work now on the interventions required to close the gap between current
performance and the performance associated with a genuinely safe road traffic system.

This requires an understanding not only of the current system’s safety weaknesses, but also of what
change may be possible in the short-term to achieve Safe System compliant outputs. Sufficient
management leadership within government road safety agencies (including road authorities), as outlined
in Chapter 3. The Road Safety Management System , is essential to achieve meaningful progress in the
delivery of these substantially different outputs.

4.3 LONG-TERM GOAL
A Safe System will exist when road users are no longer exposed to death or serious injury on the network.

AN ETHICAL APPROACH
The Safe System approach focuses on eliminating crashes that result in fatal or serious injury outcomes;
that is, those crashes that are a major threat to human health. It draws upon the Swedish Vision Zero and
the Dutch Sustainable Safety road safety visions and objectives. Safe System Principles provides
information on other key elements of the Swedish and Dutch approaches.

VISION ZERO
The Swedish Vision Zero asserts that human life and health are paramount (Tingvall, 2005) and no long-
term trade-off is allowed, reflected in the ethical imperative that ‘It can never be acceptable that people
are killed or seriously injured when moving within the road transport system’. Tingvall (2005) notes that
traditionally, mobility has been regarded as a function of the road transport system for which safety is
traded-off. However, Vision Zero turns this concept around and resets mobility as being a function of
safety. That is: no more mobility should be generated than that which is inherently safe for the system.
This ethical dimension reflects the principles accepted for workplace safety, where the effectiveness of the
working process cannot be traded-off for health risks.

Norway (NPRA, 2006), in adopting the Vision Zero goal, has highlighted the ethical approach underpinning
it, i.e. ‘Every human being is unique and irreplaceable, and we cannot accept that between 200 and 300
persons lose their lives annually in traffic’. Sweden is looking beyond Vision Zero as well, and in November
2017 introduced ‘Moving Beyond Zero’. Moving Beyond Zero is a major rethink of the Vision Zero policy
and introduces an active transport advocacy campaign.

SUSTAINABLE SAFETY
The objective of the Netherlands Sustainable Safety approach (Wegman & Aarts, 2006) is to prevent road
crashes from happening, and where this is not feasible, to reduce the incidence of (severe) injuries
whenever possible.

OECD (ITF, 2016) points out that while Vision Zero is based on an ethical principle to eliminate death and
serious injury from the transport system. Sustainable Safety takes the elimination of preventable crashes
as the starting point and attaches greater weight to cost-effectiveness in determining interventions.

It is clear that this ethical position, which states that the prime responsibility of a road authority is to
support road users in reaching the end of each trip safely, is being increasingly adopted by jurisdictions.
The following literature supports the need for measures to save lives through achieving a ‘forgiving’
system:

Elvik (2004) notes that many road users die who are not behaving illegally (see Section 4.4
Reassessing Crash Causation Factors and Crash Types ), and road authorities have a
responsibility to provide a road network which is safe to use in accordance with the road rules.
Allsop (2018) refers to the scandal of public and political tolerance of crash risks on the world’s

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 27/132



road networks, and the need to deal with new ways to address this disproportionate and
affordably removable risk in everyday life.
The Tylösand Declaration (2007), which is set out in Chapter 1. Scope of the Road Safety
Problem states that everyone has the to use roads and streets without threat to health or life.

LONG-TERM GOAL
The Safe System’s ethical goal of serious casualty elimination will not be achieved overnight. It requires a
long-term timeframe for actions to be developed and implemented in successive intermediate timeframes,
to deliver incremental serious casualty reductions (to meet interim targets over the medium-term) and
support progress towards the long-term goal. The following case studies from Belize and China show two
long-term approaches to reducing fatal and serious injury crashes.

CASE STUDY - Belize: ‘Safe Systems’ demonstration Corridor

In 2011, the government of Belize embarked on an ambitious safe system project that mobilised key
action across the key pillars of actions and a focused upgrade to the safety of 370 miles (almost 600
km) of road corridors. The Safe System project included road safety mentoring, capacity building and
monitoring and evaluation. iRAP assessments were undertaken on key high-risk national highways.
Public awareness campaigns were developed and enforcement equipment purchased with supporting
legislative changes and emergency personnel were also trained. Read more.

CASE STUDY - China: ‘Highway Safety to Cherish Life’

The Chinese Government has initiated an ambitious ‘Highway Safety to Cherish Life’ investment
across the country. The initiative includes partnerships at the national and provincial level focused on
measuring the safety of infrastructure and targeting investment to save lives. To support the
initiative, ChinaRAP has been established by the Research Institute of Highway (RIOH) and Ministry of
Transport (MoT). Read more.

It also requires commitment to interim stepwise targets, which gives prominence to the long-term goal
(ITF, 2016; Bliss & Breen, 2009; Breen, 2012).

PIARC (2012), in its National Road Safety Policies and Plans Report, notes that best practice in target
setting is represented by the government’s commitment to a long-term goal of zero fatalities with strong
interim targets that establish the path to success. Adopting a long-term Safe System approach is
recognised good practice in performance management and is supported by other key international road
safety stakeholder organisations.

Following the request of the United Nations General Assembly, on November 22, 2017, member states
reached consensus on 12 global road safety performance targets (for more information see Developing

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 28/132



Global Road Safety Targets ).

There is an increasing number of countries that have adopted a ‘Towards Zero’ or fatal and serious injury
elimination goal - the aspiration underpinning the Safe System approach. This long-term commitment to
elimination of road crash fatalities and serious injuries at the highest level of government will influence
and support the jurisdiction’s road safety management and policy and will be clearly reflected in the
proposals described in a strategy and action plan to achieve ambitious interim targets. The following case
study from the United States of America, discusses the Minnesota's Towards Zero Deaths initiative.

CASE STUDY - USA: Towards Zero Deaths (TZD) initiative

From 1995 to 2003, Minnesota traffic fatalities were on the rise. Had the trend continued, by 2015
Minnesota expected over 700 traffic fatalities. At the 2001 North Star Workshop, Minnesota’s traffic
safety leaders and professionals committed themselves to changing the trajectory of traffic fatalities.
This workshop brought together experts from Minnesota traffic safety professionals, advocates,
researchers, and experts from Washington, Sweden, and Australia. This workshop built the sense of
urgency and energy to develop the Minnesota Toward Zero Deaths (TZD) program. Read more.

CASE STUDY - Global: Making safety a global standard

Star Ratings provide an evidence-based objective measure of crash risk to ensure that safety is built-
in to designs for upgrades and new roads prior to construction. For governments and development
banks, the process opens the opportunity to set performance-based targets for vehicle occupants,
motorcyclists, pedestrians and cyclists that not only improve safety but create a high level of
transparency and accountability. The impact of raising high-risk road networks to a 3-star or better
standard will deliver long term savings in death and serious injuries, and hospital and insurance
costs, whilst also providing a positive way for Governments to track performance. Read more.

4.4 REASSESSING CRASH CAUSATION FACTORS
AND CRASH TYPES
The Safe System approach provides a different way to look at crash causation, and at the key crash types
that contribute to fatal and serious injury.

CRASH CAUSATION
The traditional understanding of crash causation was based on the belief driver or other road user error
was the primary cause of most crashes. This led to a focus on addressing human behaviour as the main
solution. As discussed in Chapter 8. Designing For Road User Characteristics and Compliance , it is
important to recognize that human behaviour is influenced by various factors, and simply changing this
behaviour may not be sufficient to prevent road crashes. A more holistic approach that considers the
interaction between human, environment, and vehicle factors is needed to address the underlying causes
of crashes.

The following example and Table 4.1 illustrate this complex interaction.

Example: A 20-year-old man is driving to an important appointment. Rain makes the road slippery, and his
tires are not in good condition. While travelling, he enters a curve with a radius of curvature that is less
than the minimum standard, loses control and runs off the road into a tree at the roadside.

TABLE 4.1: REPRESENTATION OF EVENTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES LEADING UP TO THE CRASH

System
components Event Circumstance

Vehicle Choice of vehicle Tires in poor condition

Enviroment Rain Wet and slippery surface

Enviroment Curve Below standard

Human Steering manoeuvre Psychological factors (stress, unexpected
road geometry, oversteering)

Human Loss of control Unsealed (gravel) shoulder

Enviroment Roadside conditions Tree

This example illustrates the following principles:

Each crash is the result of a succession of events occurring under specific circumstances.
Each event can be related to one of the components of the Safe System.

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 30/132



An unfavourable concurrence of events is the explanatory cause of the system.
Each separate event is largely determined by the preceding events and their circumstances.

Thus, the human-environment-vehicle system provides a conceptual framework for analysing the road
crash to identify factors on which to intervene. The Safe System approach is based on the principle that
humans make mistakes, but these mistakes should not result in fatality or serious injury. Therefore,
human, environmental, and vehicle factors must be addressed with road user limitations in mind, aiming
to prevent errors as much as possible (‘self-explaining system’) and mitigate their consequences when
they occur (‘forgiving system’).

The human-environment-vehicle system may be represented by the Haddon matrix (Table 4.2), which
combines the three components of the system and the three phases of a road crash (before, during, after).

Kimber (2003) suggests past post-crash assessments of crash contribution by researchers resulted in too
great a focus on driver behaviour at the time the data was collected. Interventions with potentially greater
effect were easily overlooked. Driver behaviour is a wide category, and it was easy to populate it by
default when the evidence was incomplete, or a better explanation was not available. Due to this
perceived driver failure predominance, the main priority for many years was to concentrate on measures
to change driver behaviour (rather than focusing on reengineering other parts of the road, vehicle or driver
system) to eliminate the failures.

This mindset is changing, but the misguided focus on the significance of driver error still remains
predominant in too much of the thinking across international communities.

Human error is to be expected. It is unhelpful to regard all human error as being capable of somehow
being eliminated and the consequences of it therefore being avoided. When the circumstances of road and
vehicle allow, routine driver errors translate into collisions, sometimes with injury or death resulting. A
focus on the infrastructure and vehicle safety levels that interact with routine driver error is a much more
useful means of identifying actions to reduce serious casualty outcomes.

Elvik & Vaa (2004) indicate that, even if all road users complied with all road rules, fatalities would only fall

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 32/132



by around 60% and injuries by 40%. Specifically, they note that around 37% of fatalities and 63% of
serious injuries do not involve non-compliance with road rules. This indicates that routine human error
leading to crashes, rather than deliberate or unintentional breaking of road rules, is a feature of human
existence and road use.

While achieving compliance with road rules by road users remains critically important, this approach alone
will not achieve the desired road safety gains in any country.

As practitioners from LMICs recognise, there is often a lower level of compliance with road rules and a
lesser respect for the rule of law in most LMICs than for many HICs. This deliberate reluctance to act in
accordance with the law would affect fatality and serious injury rates in these countries and this is one key
difference in comparison to serious crash experience in many HICs.

While a substantial potential benefit is available in the medium term through changing this illegal road
user behaviour in LMICs, a further focus upon improvements in infrastructure and vehicle safety over in
the medium to longer term will be essential in providing a forgiving system (a Safe System) for crashes
arising from underlying (and not illegal) human error, as is the current and strengthening focus in many
HICs.

Therefore, research findings from HICs about the role of safer roads and vehicles are very relevant to
LMICs.

Stigson (2011) conducted further analysis on the different weaknesses in the traffic system’s traditional
components and determined that they play a greater or lesser role in influencing the outcome of crashes.
The analysis confirms the potential for road infrastructure to more substantially impact upon fatal crash
outcomes for car occupants than other factors in HICs.

While system weaknesses should usefully be analysed for two-wheeler, cyclists and pedestrians in HICs
and also in LMICs, vehicle safety improvement (as users shift over the next decades from two wheelers to
vehicles) and improved behavioural compliance will offer great opportunities for reducing crashes in most
LMICs compared to most HICs. However, the potential contribution of safer infrastructure to substantially
reduce fatalities should be reinforced with all road authorities.

KEY CRASH TYPES
The focus on reducing fatal and serious injuries through the Safe System approach (as opposed to casualty
crash reduction) has had a profound impact on understanding key crash types.

The shift in focus from crash numbers to casualties has a subtle but important impact on crash assessment
and the strategies to address risk. Different types of crashes will produce different crash outcomes,
including greater or lesser numbers of injuries per crash. For example, analysis from New Zealand on
crashes and casualties demonstrates this point. Table 4.3 (NZTA, 2011) shows the proportions of the three
most common types of crashes and casualties that result in fatalities and serious injuries for rural roads
(excluding motorways).

TABLE 4.3: PROPORTION OF THE THREE MOST COMMON TYPES OF CRASHES AND CASUALTIES
RESULTING IN FATALITIES AND SERIOUS INJURIES FOR RURAL ROADS (EXCLUDING
MOTORWAYS) (SOURCE: NZTA, 2011)

% of high
Key crash types severity crashes % of high severity casualties

on New Zealand on New Zealand rural roads
rural roads

Run-off-road 56% 51%

Head-on 19% 25%

At intersections 16% 16%

Table 4.3 shows that 92% of fatal and serious injuries on rural roads in New Zealand are attributed to the
three key crash types. The table also shows that a higher proportion (1.3 to 1) of severe casualties (fatal
and serious injuries) occur through head-on crashes (25%) than is reflected in the proportion of severe
head-on crashes (19%). This indicates that the head-on crash type is of greater significance for overall
fatalities than the severe crash numbers would indicate.

Similarly, analysis of crashes by fatal and serious injury (compared to all injuries) is likely to provide a
different picture of the risk across the network.

The relative incidence of various fatal and serious crash types will differ from most HICs to most LMICs due
to the differences in traffic environments. The types of vehicles and their relative share of the overall
traffic volume are two examples of likely difference. It is essential for the road safety agencies and road
authorities to know what the major crash types are in their country and where they occur (also see
Chapter 7. Roles, Responsibilities, Policy Development and Programmes and Chapter 10. Assessing
Potential Risks and Identifying Issues ). Agencies should be able to identify road sections with a higher risk
of fatalities and serious injuries on their network.

The predominant road crash types that result in fatalities and serious injuries in high-income countries are
typically:

Crashes involving vehicle occupants only:
Head-on (between two vehicles) crashes (most often on rural roads).
Run-off-road crashes (most often on rural roads).
Intersection crashes (particularly side impact) (most often on urban roads).

Crashes involving vehicles and vulnerable road users (involving pedestrians, motorcyclists and
cyclists).

For many low- and middle-income countries, key crash types include:

Pedestrian/vehicle crashes (most often on urban roads and within sections of linear urban
development).
Motorcyclist (single vehicle or with another vehicle) involved crashes (most often on rural
roads).
Light passenger van (single vehicle or with another vehicle) involved crashes (most often on
rural roads).
Truck and bus involved crashes with another vehicle, particularly head-on and rear-end crashes

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 34/132



with motorcycles (most often on rural roads).
Cyclist/vehicle crashes (to varying degrees in low- and middle-income countries) (most often on
urban roads).

The case study from India discusses the implementation of a speed regulation system.

CASE STUDY - India: Implementation of speed regulation system on highway A10

An innovation in engineering design practice was piloted in India on the Kamataka State Highway
Improvement Project (550 km). The project demonstrated how the iRAP Star Rating protocol can be
used to rate the safety of a road prior to construction or rehabilitation with information drawn from
the road design plans. Final designs for construction are anticipated to provide a reduction in severe
injuries of 45% in India. Read more.

4.5 SAFE SYSTEM – RECOGNISING SHARED
RESPONSIBILITY
The Safe System approach places requirements on the road safety management system. These
requirements include:

Recognition and acceptance of the concept of shared responsibility.
Recognition and acceptance of the role of ‘system providers’ or ‘designers’.
Alignment of the Safe System with other policies (e.g. public and occupational health,
environment, poverty reduction, mobility and accessibility, etc.) (Peden et al., 2004).

CONCEPT OF SHARED RESPONSIBILITY
The system will ultimately need to protect all road users, including those who act illegally, from death and
serious injury. In the interim period the focus should be on protecting those who do not act illegally and
those who could be killed or seriously injured by the illegal actions or errors of other road users.

As noted above, as well as road user behaviour, road- and vehicle-related safety factors play a substantial
part in fatal crashes. Progressive movement towards a Safe System requires all key stakeholders to accept
their responsibilities to provide for safe overall operation of the network. This is in addition to the
responsibilities that individual road users bear. This concept of ‘shared responsibility’ is at the core of the
shift in traditional thinking about road crash contributing factors that a Safe System requires.

The Safe System approach looks to infrastructure design, speed limits and vehicle safety features that
individually (and together) minimise violent crash forces. It relies upon adequate education, legislation and
enforcement efforts to gain high levels of road user compliance with road rules; effective licensing regimes
to control the safety of drivers using the system (particularly novice drivers and riders); and the
cancelation of licences when serious offences are committed. A good standard of emergency post-crash
care is also needed.

This fundamental shift away from a ‘blame the road user’ focus, to an approach that compels system
providers or designers to provide an intrinsically safe traffic environment, is recognised as the key to
achieving ambitious road safety outcomes (ITF, 2016).

THE ROLE OF SYSTEM PROVIDERS
While individual road users are expected to be alert and to comply with all road rules, the ‘system
providers’ - including the government and industry organisations that design, build, maintain and regulate
roads and vehicles - have a primary responsibility to provide a safe operating environment for road users
(see Box 4.1). This requires recognition of the many other system providers (beyond the road engineers
and vehicle suppliers) who impact on use of the network and who also carry a major responsibility for
supporting achievement of safer, survivable outcomes.

BOX 4.1: SYSTEM PROVIDERS INCLUDE

Legislators/regulators/enforcement agencies who are expected to identify unsafe but

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 36/132



currently legal behaviours and implement new compliance measures to create a safer
operating system.
Employers providing vehicles (both light passenger and heavy commercial) for use by their
staff and requiring a range of driving tasks as part of employment contracts.
Agencies providing crash site and hospital emergency medical care.
Driver and rider licensing authorities seeking to improve the safety of drivers when licensed.
Road safety agencies.
Land use planning decision-makers whose decisions affect traffic flows and roadside access.
Road users, where compliance with road rules is to be sought.

The studies noted in Section 4.4. Reassessing Crash Causation Factors and Crash Types confirm the
fundamental importance of those responsible for delivering safer roads and roadsides, safer travel speeds
and safer vehicles, as well as safer behaviours. Road users should not have to operate in a system full of
flawed designs that increase the probability of error.

Sweden’s Vision Zero ‘envisages a chain of responsibility that both begins and ends with the system
designers (i.e. providers)’. The responsibility chain (Tingvall, 2005) has three steps:

The system designers (providers) are responsible for the safety of the system.
The users have the responsibility to follow rules and regulations.
If the road users fail to follow the rules and regulations, the responsibility falls back on the
providers of the system.

Many challenges are involved in monitoring ongoing performance of the responsibilities of system
providers or system designers. They need to accept accountability for their outputs.

While the principle of shared responsibility has been naturally accepted in the road safety strategies of
those countries who have adopted the Safe System approach, the necessary substantial (and often subtle)
adjustment required to become accepted operating practice will take some time to achieve across
agencies (including road authorities).

Road safety responsibilities also extend to the broader community. For example, health professionals have
a role in helping their clients to manage their safety on the roads; and parents contribute significantly to
the road safety education of their children - not only through their direct supervision of learner drivers, but
also as role models through their own driving and road user behaviour. The Danish Road Safety Accident
Investigation Board case study provides an example of shared responsibility.

CASE STUDY - Denmark: Danish Road Safety Accident Investigation Board

Road safety is in Denmark seen as a shared responsibility. The Danish Road Traffic Accident
Investigation Board (AIB) is one of the important players in the continued efforts to prevent road
accidents and minimize their implications. The AIB´s main purpose is to come up with new knowledge
and make recommendations for proposed actions to be implemented. The AIB consists of a multi-
disciplinary group that makes in-depth analyses of frequent and serious accident types to create a
more accurate picture of the factors contributing to accidents and recurring problems. Read more.

ALIGNMENT OF SAFE SYSTEM WITH OTHER POLICIES AND SOCIETAL GOALS
Road Safety decisions should not be made in isolation but should be aligned with broader community
values, such as economic; land use planning; human, occupational and environmental health; consumer
goals; and mobility and accessibility as outlined in Chapter 1. Scope of the Road Safety Problem . There is
strong alignment between the Safe System and these goals. The following two case studies show how
alignment of policies can be beneficial to safety.

CASE STUDY - Denmark: Road standards: United Solutions implemented voluntarily

The update of the road standards on road safety issues concerns the main road safety documents for
e.g. good road safety practice, and guidelines/instructions for how to do road safety audits and
inspections. It is also for ensuring and giving feedback to the other groups if there are overlap
between the groups and their material and to make sure the wording and recommendations are the
same. Skilled professionals and experts from across the road sector are behind the drafting of the
road standards. There are contributors from the government agencies including road administrations,
police, transport authorities, municipalities, but also NGO’s like biking organisations, unions,
universities and private companies or the industry with interest in the sector. Read more.



CASE STUDY - Denmark: Interplay between public authority, individuals and society in
Denmark

Danish road safety is influenced by many players, ranging from public authorities and interest groups
to the media. This is a strength and provides for public acceptance of measures and a lively debate
on how to improve road safety for all. Together with road users’ own personal responsibility to act
responsibly and carefully on the roads, a strong sense of community can bring down the accident
figures and create safer transport. Read more.

4.6 SAFE SYSTEM – SCIENTIFIC SAFETY
PRINCIPLES AND THEIR APPLICATION
The Safe System approach marks a shift from focusing solely on crashes to reducing fatalities and serious
injuries. Well-established safety principles underpin the Safe System approach as set out in Chapter 2. Key
Developments in Road Safety . Further principles include the following:

The combination of infrastructure safety features, vehicle safety features and travel speed(s) of
crash-involved vehicles determines the impact forces that humans are subjected to in any
crash. These interactions are to be managed to avoid fatal or serious injury outcomes.
Safety levels are to be the key determinant of sustainable mobility levels. Travel speeds require
management to target levels below those known speed thresholds that deliver fatal or serious
injury crash impact energies (based on the level of vehicle safety and mix, and the nature of
protective infrastructure characteristics) (see also Section 4.6. Safe System – Scientific Safety
Principles and their Application and Section 4.7. Safe System Elements & Application ).
Safe System approaches typically aim to develop a road transport system that is better able to
accommodate human error by providing a safe operating environment - despite human
fallibility - and providing effective post-crash care.
A system-wide intervention strategy addressing all crash-phases and all Safe System elements
is to be adopted, which addresses the safety of all road users.
Legislative and enforcement strategies that achieve widespread user compliance with road
rules and laws are necessary, as are strategies which deter the entry and exit arrangements of
users and vehicles to the road system.

DEVELOPMENT OF THE SAFE SYSTEM APPROACH
As noted earlier, the Safe System approach builds upon the ground-breaking road safety efforts of the
Netherlands and Sweden.

NETHERLANDS SUSTAINABLE SAFETY
Wegman and Aarts (2006) outlined a set of guiding principles (based on the Dutch Sustainable Safety
Vision) considered necessary to achieve sustainably safe road traffic. The principles are based on scientific
theories and research methods arising from disciplines including psychology, biomechanics and traffic
engineering, and are set out in Table 4.4 below.

In 2018, SWOV (2018) recalibrated this vision and the five road safety principles are now strengthened
with new insights, thereby providing a basis for specialized solutions:

Three of the five principles are design principles:
1. FUNCTIONALITY of roads.
2. (BIO)MECHANICS: limiting differences in speed, direction, mass and size, and giving road

users appropriate protection.
3. PSYCHOLOGICS: aligning the design of the road traffic environment with road user

competencies.
The other two principles are organization principles now:

1. Effectively allocating RESPONSIBILITY.
2. LEARNING and INNOVATING in the traffic system.

SWEDEN’S VISION ZERO
Tingvall (2022) commented on the challenges Sweden faces in redefining transport policy principles to
reflect Vision Zero (or the Safe System approach):

Sweden has found a new way in recent years to express transport policy. In summary,
‘accessibility can only be developed within the framework of safety and environment’.
While mobility and accessibility make up the functionality of the transport system, the safety
parameter (like many other elements in a society) is not a variable in an equation, but has
threshold limits that cannot be exceeded.
This shift is gradual. The new Swedish speed limit system is a good demonstration of how
mindsets shift over time, with 80 km/h now the maximum speed for an undivided road (unless
there are low traffic volumes), and this is intended to be absolute.
While obtaining public acceptance is challenging, Sweden is gradually changing its approach to
permissible travel speeds, and therefore to the setting of speed limits on new roads, or

determining the investments necessary to modify existing roads to allow higher limits, based on
the new speed limit system. This is where the safety benefits will be realised.
The mobility needs will then be the deciding parameter for the infrastructure investment
necessary to have safe higher travel speeds. Is it worthwhile to invest in safety solutions to
increase mobility? This is the question, but it has taken many years to have this rather natural
logic understood and accepted (see Box 4.2 below).

BOX 4.2: FUNDAMENTAL SHIFT IN THINKING: SAFETY AS THE LIMITATION MOBILITY – INHERENT TO A SAFE
SYSTEM APPROACH

Traditional approach – road authorities have striven to specify desired mobility (travel
speeds) while doing what they can to improve safety on a length of road.

‘You can travel from A to B at 100 km/h and we will make some improvements to these two lanes two-
way rural road to improve your travel safety’

Safe System thinking – achieve safe travel, by determining the travel speed which can be
adopted without risk of death or serious injury on this length of road.

‘You can travel at this safe speed from A to B based on the Safe System elements that work and that
will avoid fatal and serious injuries in the event of a crash. You can only travel faster if infrastructure
safety is improved.’ (e.g. median barriers so that head-on collisions are prevented, grade-separated
intersections so that the likelihood of side-on crashes is minimised, etc.).

UNDERSTANDING THE SAFE SYSTEM MODEL
The elements of the integrated, human-centric Safe System model for safe road use and their interactions
can be depicted as follows (Figure 4.2):

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 41/132



FIGURE 4.2: MODEL OF THE SAFE SYSTEM APPROACH (SOURCE: ITF, 2008)



The Safe System design model has four main elements (including alert and compliant road users) plus five
supporting activities that can be adjusted and applied in agreement with the four main elements to assist
in making crashes more likely to be survivable.

The four main design elements are:

Safe roads and roadsides – that are predictable and forgiving of mistakes. They are self-
explaining in that their design encourages safe travel speeds and help avoid errors.
Safe speeds – travel speeds that suit the function and level of safety of the road. People
understand and comply with the speed limits and drive according to the conditions.
Safe vehicles – that prevent crashes and protect road users, including occupants, pedestrians
and cyclists, in the event of a crash.

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 42/132



Safe road users – road users that are alert and unimpaired, and who comply with road rules.
They take steps to improve safety, and demand and expect safety improvements.

The key supporting Safe System elements include:

Emergency medical management for post-crash care (the fifth UN Decade of Action pillar).
Understanding of crashes on the network, which requires good data to enable risks across
sections of the network to be accurately identified.
Control of admittance (entry and exit) of drivers to/from the road transport system (licensing
arrangements including graduated licensing arrangements).
Effective legislation and systems, enforcement and justice system support.
Educating and informing the public.

The last three elements in the list above support achieving road user compliance with the road rules.

In summary, for alert and compliant road users, a combination of vehicle safety features, safety
characteristics of the infrastructure and travel speed are required, together with effective emergency
medical post-crash care, in order to avoid a fatal or disabling serious injury outcome in the event of a
crash.

THE CRITICAL ROLE OF TRAVEL SPEED IN ACHIEVING A SAFE
SYSTEM
Travel speeds are a critical variable within a Safe System with allowable safe speeds on any part of the
network being dependent upon vehicle types (and their protective features), the forgiving and protective
nature of the infrastructure and roadsides, the restrictions upon roadside access to the roadway and the
presence of vulnerable road users. All these factors will determine a maximum vehicle speed on each
section of the network above which an unacceptable probability of death is likely from any collision.

Injury outcomes and the creation of an inherently safe road system are largely dependent on the kinetic
energy in the system. At the moment of impact, the force on the body can exceed the body's tolerance.

The amount of kinetic energy (Ek) is calculated according to the following formula:

Ek = 1/2 mv2

where m = mass (kg) and v = velocity (m/s)

The formula shows that kinetic energy does not increase linearly with speed, but with the square of the
speed. This has important implications for how speed affects the road safety. A small increase in travel
speed can significantly increase the probability of a serious injury outcome (Figure 4.3).

FIGURE 4.3: THE EFFECT OF A SMALL TRAVELLING SPEED CHANGE INTO AN INJURY OUTCOME (SOURCE:
AUSTROADS, 2018)



SPEED MANAGEMENT IS ALSO CRITICAL TO OTHER SOCIETAL
GOALS
Reducing speed is one of the most effective ways to improve safety, saving lives and debilitating injuries.
However, the opportunities that lowered travel speeds offer to other societal goals are generally under-
appreciated. Reducing speed also generates multiple other benefits fundamentals to sustainable mobility:
reduced climate change impacts of road transport, increased efficiency (fuel and vehicle maintenance),
improved inclusion and walkability (Job & Mbugua, 2020).

Job and Mbugua (2020) highlighted that when considering the full range of economic impacts (GHGs,
emissions, fuel, etc.), economically optimal speeds are lower than expected and typically lower than
prevailing speed limits compared to limited evaluations of impacts based on travel time savings alone.

In Oslo (Norway), the effects on human health and the environment were assessed by comparing lower
speed limits to higher ones. During periods when lower speed limits, also known as Environmental Speed
Limits (ESL), were implemented, there were significant reductions in PM10 (particulate matter) emissions,
a type of air pollution and noise levels. When speeds were dropped from 80 km/h to 60 km/h, research
showed ‘that whilst emissions of NOx and CO2 do not seem to show significant changes with ESL
implementation, PM10 emissions are reduced by 6–12% and annual concentration levels are reduced up to
8%, with a subsequent reduction in population exposure.’ (Lopez-Aparicio et al., 2020). The benefits of
decreasing PM emission levels include lower cases of asthma, irregular heartbeats and decreased lung
function when related to air pollution.

Research conducted across Australia provides scientific evidence supporting the lowering of speed limits
and its positive impact on mobility and liveability costs. Liveability costs are impacted by speed limits due
to the frequent need to accelerate and decelerate in urban areas. ‘Further, reductions in speed bring about
a reduction in vehicle operating costs with less wear and greater energy (fuel) efficiency, and less pollution
and noise’. Additionally, research shows that aggressive driving behaviours, such as constant and quick
lane changes, providing little headway, and speeding from traffic lights, can lead to fuel consumption and
CO2 emissions ‘as much as four times that of non-aggressive drivers’ (Archer et al., 2008).

In São Paulo (Brazil), research determined that progressively lowering speed limits not only impacts traffic

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 44/132



congestion but also reduces vehicle crashes. Research ‘provides evidence that speed limit reductions can
be rationalized in cities that are concerned about severe congestion problems’. Moreover, evidence was
found that ‘the speed limit reduction likely had strongly progressive impacts’ (Ang et al., 2020). In many
large cities, higher speeds lead to a higher number of vehicle crashes, many of them fatal. The more
vehicle crashes there are, the more congestion results. Lower speeds lead to fewer crashes, less road
congestion, and trips with reduced overall delay.

Speed management can be achieved through a range of interventions including road infrastructure and in-
vehicle technologies, as well as enforcement and education of road users.

MEAN SPEED AND CRASH RISK
Crash outcomes, especially fatal crash outcomes, are influenced directly by the travel speed of vehicles at
the time of impact.

Figure 4.4 shows the ‘Power Model’ of speed, developed as a result of reliable research establishing the
relationship between speed and crash outcomes by comparing safety outcomes before and after speed
interventions (Nilsson, 2004; Turner at al., 2024). Based on the model, a 1% increase in average speed is
associated with a 2% increase in injury crash frequency, a 3% increase in severe crash frequency, and a
4% increase in fatal crash frequency.

FIGURE 4.4: RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SPEED AND CRASH OUTCOME (SOURCE: NILSSON, 2004)



More recent research (Elvik, 2013; Elvik et al., 2019) suggests that the relationship between speed and
crash risk is exponential. The revised model reveals a greater impact of vehicle speed on high-speed roads

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 45/132



than on lower-speed roads. The GRSF Speed Impact Tool is designed to help calculate the change in crash
risk due to a change in speed.

INFLUENCING KINETIC ENERGY LEVEL IN CRASHES
As indicated in the safety principles above, an important way to reduce fatal or serious injury crash
outcomes is through better management of crash energy, so that no individual road user is exposed to
crash forces that are likely to result in death or serious injury.

Conditions that support limiting crash energy to levels below which fatal or serious injury crash outcomes
are relatively unlikely, are now becoming better understood, but are still not well recognised or applied
system-wide in most countries.

A key strategy is therefore to move (over time) to set posted speed limits in response to the level of
protection offered by the existing (or improved) road infrastructure and the safety levels of the vehicles
and vehicle mix in operation on sections of the network.

Mobility needs to be constrained by Safe System compliance. Future safe infrastructure investment will
often be necessary before considering raising the speed limits on sections of the network in order to avoid
increased fatalities or serious injuries.

BOX 4.3: AN ALTERNATIVE ROAD INFRASTRUCTURE DESIGN APPROACH

Tingvall (2005) notes that while infrastructure design has previously been built on crash prevention, the
alternative Safe System philosophy is built on kinetic energy management and injury prevention
(secondary prevention rather than primary prevention). Speed is now more related to the crash
outcome rather than the driver’s ability to keep the vehicle in control. This has led to more extensive
use of roadside and median barriers, while intersections are redesigned to roundabouts, and roadside
access (and development) needs to be more fully controlled. These are examples where the number of
crashes might increase, but where the outcome is controlled so that human tolerance to serious health
losses is not exceeded.

McInerney et al. (2018) state that the discipline of managing energy exchange and related forces
currently exists in the fields of structural engineering for buildings and mechanical engineering for
machines but is rarely sighted in the design of roads. For infrastructure to provide the key building
blocks for a Safe System, road engineering design practice worldwide must include provision for the
management of kinetic energy. For example, there are simulation programs that examine an errant
vehicle departure into a roadside environment, which calculate the change in kinetic energy as the
errant vehicle encounters roadside hazards. The rate of kinetic energy dissipation can then be
translated into differing collision severity potential.

4.7 SAFE SYSTEM ELEMENTS & APPLICATION
While the Safe System approach has been adopted as the foundation of many countries’ road safety
strategies, concept adoption and effective implementation are two different things. Implementation
remains a considerable challenge.

The supporting enabler for planning, development and implementation of Safe System interventions is the
road safety management system operating in any country (See Chapter 3. Road Safety Management
System for guidance).

THE ROLE OF SAFER INFRASTRUCTURE
The potential for road infrastructure safety treatments to provide certain and immediate reduction in crash
likelihood and severity is well recognised. With adequate resources, infrastructure has the ability to
eliminate nearly all fatal and serious crash outcomes. Many national and provincial road safety strategies
have highlighted the role of infrastructure in making progress towards a Safe System.

Some examples of high-performing infrastructure treatments from these and other studies include
(McInerney et al., 2018; also see Section 11.3. Intervention Selection and Prioritisation ):

Well-designed roundabouts are able to reduce deaths by up to 80% (BITRE, 2012).
Grade separated pedestrian crossings reduce casualty crashes by 85% (Austroads, 2012).
Wire rope barriers (i.e., cable barrier systems) in the centre and edge of roads reduce fatal
crashes by up to 90% (Larsson et al., 2003).

All road users need to be considered when designing or upgrading road infrastructure. This includes:

The design of road infrastructure and the broader street environment should start with the
needs of the most vulnerable users and then progress through to the safety needs of the least
vulnerable.
A road design and corridor planning exercise that progresses through the needs of pedestrians,
cyclists, animal drawn carts, motorcycles, cars, trucks and buses will ensure that appropriate
function, speed, road space allocation, and design features are incorporated to deliver the best
safety outcomes.
This is not only a critical step for road authorities in planning new roads, but it is a particularly
challenging issue for safety review and retrofitting of existing networks over time.
Traffic management measures play a significant role in influencing the road safety situation.
In LMICs, the traffic mix is highly diverse, user compliance levels are usually low, and
regulations and rules are often set by a transport department that is separate from the road
authority, resulting in many coordination challenges.
The opportunities for controlling the operation of vehicles on certain roads by type or space, or
by day/night use to improve safety outcomes, warrants further examination. This already
occurs to some limited extent in many countries.

THE ROLE OF SPEED MANAGEMENT
Netherlands Sustainable Safety in Section 4.6. Safe System - Scientific Safety Principles and Their
Application outlined the important principle of safe travel speed which underpins a Safe System approach.
Critical speed threshold levels in traffic crashes differ depending upon the type of crash being considered.

CRASH TYPES AND CRITICAL TRAVEL SPEEDS
Table 4.5 presents the survivable impact speeds for different crash scenarios. These Safe System speeds
should be used as maximum acceptable speed limits to avoid the risk of fatality and serious injury,
assuming sufficient infrastructure and optimal visibility conditions.

TABLE 4.5: SAFE SYSTEM SURVIVABLE IMPACT SPEEDS FOR DIFFERENT CRASH SCENARIOS
(SOURCE: TURNER ET AL., 2024)

Safe System
Type of road/road section survivable

speed

Roads/road sections with possible crashes between cars and Max. 30 km/h
vulnerable road users including 2- and 3- wheelers

Roads/road sections with intersections with possible side-on Max. 50 km/h
crashes between cars

Roads/road sections with possible frontal (head-on) crashes Max. 70 km/h
between cars

Roads/road sections with no likelihood of side-on or frontal Max. 100 km/h
crashes between cars and limited access (usually motorways)

In certain parts of the transport network, such as high standard motorways, the risk of crash outcomes
involving high levels of energy transfer (and therefore being fatal) is low in relation to the total distance
travelled by vehicles on freeway standard links.

Motorways would typically have no at-grade intersections, would have median barriers installed to prevent
head-on crashes, and side barriers installed to protect vehicle occupants from roadside objects, and would
also segregate vulnerable road user activity such as pedestrians, cyclists and motorcyclists from higher
speed traffic.

In these circumstances, and subject to limitations on vehicle flow volumes per lane, higher operating
speeds (100 km/h or more) can generally be safely supported for vehicles with a high standard of safety
features.

On the other hand, for two-lane, two-way roads in rural environments with unprotected roadside hazards,
frequent intersections, unsealed shoulders and variable standards of horizontal and vertical geometry, the
risks of serious casualty crash outcomes are much higher.

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 48/132



Table 4.5 illustrates that for these situations, even for a vehicle with the best currently available safety
features, the road cannot support a travel speed much above 50 to 70 km/h if fatalities are to be avoided.
If roadside hazards are protected (with barriers) and intersections are treated to reduce speeds to 50
km/h, the travel speeds on the road can be 70 km/h. The addition of median barriers would enable higher
operating speeds to be considered.

Lower speed in urban areas is also critical to improving road safety. Speed limits must be adapted to the
prevailing traffic situation and to groups of different road users often using the same space.

Complementary infrastructure measures such as speed humps and small roundabouts at key locations can
help to ensure that speeds are controlled effectively to ensure that vulnerable road users are not exposed
to impact speeds above 30 km/h.

On higher-order urban arterial or distributor roads the function and use can be prioritised around achieving
high traffic flows on road sections, whilst managing exchange at intersections or dedicated mid-block
facilities. On these roads, vehicles can drive somewhat faster and tend to travel longer distances. Speed
management on these roads should be supported by camera based (fixed or flexible) speed limit
enforcement on corridors and at traffic lights. Pedestrians and cyclists can cross at intersections or
dedicated mid-block facilities with appropriate localised speed management in place. Ultimately, the aim is
to reduce exposure to high-speed motor vehicles, particularly at conflict points.

On the other hand, lower-order roads such as access roads must be managed to facilitate exchange
between different road users at lower speed. Speeds in these areas and on these roads are low, not
through police enforcement, but by infrastructure (e.g. speed humps, mini roundabouts, chicanes, etc.). In
some areas it may be appropriate to limit vehicle access.

Below is a case study that illustrates the effectiveness of lowered speed limits in urban road environments.

CASE STUDY - Finland: Safety Impacts of lowering speed limits in urban areas

The number of road traffic crashes resulting in personal injury have decreased in Finland after speed
limit changes were adopted in urban areas. After the changes made to the speed limits in 2004, the
number of injury crashes decreased by 9% on streets with lower speed limits compared to streets
where limits were not lowered between the periods 1998-2003 and 2005-2009. The number of all
injury crashes decreased by 21%, pedestrian injury crashes by 19% and injury crashes of motor
vehicle occupants by 34% on the streets where speed limit was reduced from 40 km/h to 30km/h.
Read more (PDF, 362 kb) .

Speed management is at the centre of developing a safe road system. Where infrastructure safety cannot
be improved in the foreseeable future and a road has a high crash risk, then reviews of speed limits,
supported by appropriate and competent enforcement to support compliance, are a critically important
option. Support through targeted infrastructure measures to achieve lower speeds should be considered.

For example, lowering speed limits from 100 km/h to 90 km/h may reduce mean speeds by 4 to 5 km/h if
there is a reasonable level of enforcement. The scientific and evidence-based research shows that this will

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 49/132



reduce fatalities on these road sections by up to about 20% (e.g. Sliogeris, 1992). This assumes, obviously,
some enforcement support.

THE ROLE OF VEHICLES
FOR HICS

Since 1996, vehicle safety (or at least, car occupant safety) has been subjected to market forces rather
than solely relying upon regulation across Europe through EuroNCAP (European New Car Assessment
Programme). There is wide acknowledgment that this enhanced approach to advancing rapid development
in vehicle safety has been successful. The automotive industry has reacted very quickly to the
expectations of the market with regard to car occupant protection. Other New Car Assessment
Programmes (NCAP) have been introduced in many regions and countries (Australasia, Japan and many
more). The introduction of Electronic Stability Control/Programme (ESC or ESP) in vehicles has been very
successful, with unexpected high effectiveness and a market penetration that is quicker than any other
previous example (Tingvall, 2005). ESC is now a mainstream part of NCAP ratings.

The opportunities from new safety technologies in vehicles, which are now available or likely to become
available, together with the level of inherent crashworthiness of many new vehicles in HICs are
remarkable. These benefits should be sought by LMICs as an early priority. LatinCAP in Latin America and
ASEAN NCAP are two examples of recent extension of NCAP to LMICs, which will arm consumers with
safety information and drive market change. Furthermore, Global NCAP has recently been established and
is likely to be highly influential.

Appropriate promotion of the benefits of safety features and overall vehicle safety levels needs to be
carried out by road safety agencies. Road authorities should develop their awareness of these new vehicle
safety features, particularly ways in which specific infrastructure treatments could leverage improvement
in crash outcomes. Road safety agency actions could include (Tierney et al., 2005):

Informing the community about why vehicle safety matters and encouraging consumer demand
for safer vehicles through support for NCAP programmes; government leadership by requiring
5-star NCAP safety-rated vehicles for all new government fleet procurement.
Directly and indirectly influencing vehicle suppliers to improve safety standards and requiring
certain vehicle safety features in new vehicles as a condition for initial registration, such as
electronic stability control (ESC) and head protecting side air bags.

Progress with emerging technologies such as collision avoidance, intelligent speed adaptation, and inbuilt
alcohol and fatigue detectors should be monitored by road safety agencies. Pilot studies have been
conducted in many vehicle fleets internationally for research purposes in order to establish costs and
benefits.

Other initiatives that countries need to pursue include:

Encouraging corporate fleet operators to procure safer vehicles.
Eliminating inappropriate vehicle advertising – showing fast vehicle speeds and dangerous
handling with racing car livery shown and glamorised on drivers and on mainstream vehicles
which are available for public purchase.

Younger drivers should be made aware of the safest used vehicles available in the market in relevant price

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 50/132



brackets to encourage their purchase and improve the chances of survival of young drivers in their higher
risk early years of driving.

Developments in heavy vehicle safety include ESC responsive braking systems, and fatigue and speed
monitoring equipment. New Truck Assessment Programmes may emerge in coming years for heavy
vehicle prime movers. Again, road safety agencies need to be aware of these developments.

FOR LIMCS

Many opportunities for improvement exist in the vehicle safety features available to LMIC markets. There
are reports of vehicles imported from other countries without safety features fitted, which are standard
inclusions in the automobile supplier’s home market (this is reportedly in an endeavour to limit costs).

Some countries impose higher rates of tax on safety equipment in vehicles as a misplaced luxury item
revenue raising measure, which discourages their fitment. Some key issues are:

Suppliers could be encouraged to improve provision of critical safety features through local
NCAP testing and through promotion to the public of NCAP test results.
Arranging approved language translation and publication on the web (with supporting publicity)
of NCAP material that is currently available. Automobile clubs can be an important partner in
supporting this activity.
Government fleets can provide leadership by being prepared to specify best practice safety
features in their vehicles, including basic features such as rear seatbelt provision in those
countries where it is not yet mandated. Rear seat occupants could then be required by the
employer to wear seatbelts where they are available.
There will also be benefits in providing information to the public about relative safety ratings of
lower cost used vehicles, which will become increasingly available in LMIC markets.
There is a high level of inertia in LMICs towards implementing such vehicle measures.
Outcomes in the above areas would be an important indicator to communities of the
commitment on the part of governments and road safety agencies.
Movement from motorised two-wheelers (i.e. motorcycles) to improved public transport
provision and to cars (increasingly occurring in some countries) can be beneficial for road safety
outcomes in overall terms, subject to the rates of motorisation.

COMPLIANCE AND HUMAN ERROR
Maximising road user behaviour that is compliant with road rules remains an important issue. This requires
the presence and active implementation of effective legislative arrangements; data systems for vehicles,
driver licensing and offences (and their linkage); enforcement; justice system support; and offence
processing, as well as follow-up capacities.

Human error, rather than deliberate illegal behaviour, is an important contributor to fatal and serious
crashes. Measures to reduce the prospect of human error need to be taken to guide use of the network.
Clear consistent guidance and reasonable information processing demands upon the road users along a
route is necessary to reduce uncertainty and indecision. These issues are discussed in detail in Chapter 8.
Design For Road User Characteristics and Compliance , but key issues include:

It is not usually feasible to protect those road users who carry out extreme illegal acts or
violations, or those that they may injure. For example, this applies to road users who are drink

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 51/132



driving or drugged driving (or pedestrians that are affected by either alcohol or drugs),
speeding, failing to wear seatbelts, or failing to wear helmets when riding motorcycles.
Violations that are extreme in nature must be addressed as a high priority. However, for low
level illegal behaviours (Wundersitz & Baldock, 2011), the system should be capable in the
long-term of providing some protection from serious casualties for third parties and to some
extent, where possible, for those carrying out many of the low-level violations.
To achieve maximum road user compliance with laws and road rules, it is essential to deter
drivers from breaking these laws in all circumstances. Many people will comply, but a
proportion will get away with what they can get away with. Many will usually not be focused in
the short-term at least, on readily changing their behaviour. This is a major challenge for many
LMICs in particular.
That is why the probability of detection, certainty of a penalty if detected, and a deterrent level
of penalty are so important. Many well-meaning community members have some difficulties
with accepting, or indeed understanding, deterrence theory. However, those who have had
exposure (e.g. observing the immediacy of reductions in drink driving fatalities as police
substantially increase random breath testing [RBT] intensity in a region), recognise only too
well the sensitivity of the driving population (and the level of related deaths and serious injury
crashes) to increased general deterrence, as represented by increased widespread visible
enforcement. Public information and education are necessary to inform the public about why
rules are important and what the consequences will be of being detected when disobeying
these laws.
Effective enforcement to deter unsafe behaviours is the most effective form of road user
education.

Developing a respected and effective police enforcement capability requires high-level management
competence, good standards of governance, quality research to guide efforts, and a strong results focus.

4.8 SAFE SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION
Progress in LMICs will depend heavily on substantial expert support to accelerate a ‘learning by doing’
approach. A key thread running throughout this manual is practical guidance concerning the
implementation of the Safe System approach. A suggested path for road safety agencies in LMICs for
moving from weak to stronger institutional capacity, by implementing effective practice through
demonstration programmes (or projects), is outlined in Chapter 6. Road Safety Targets, Investment
Strategies, Plans and Projects . The programmes should include area-based projects involving all relevant
agencies and some national level policy reviews. This approach will support the production of steady
improvement in road safety results from all agencies.

Development of a more complete understanding and uptake of a Safe System approach, after adoption as
official policy by a country, will take time. It will rely upon a continuous improvement process that
examines and implements options, often in innovative ways, to improve performance.

While the key principles of a Safe System are well established (ITF, 2008 and 2016) and underpin the UN
Global Plan for the Second Decade of Action for Road Safety (WHO, 2021), the challenge now is to
translate these aspirations into practical policy implementation. This is especially important in low-and
middle-income countries, where the burden of road injury is highest.

A joint International Transport Forum - World Bank Working Group on ‘Implementing the Safe System’ has
developed a theoretical framework to guide those seeking to implement the Safe System approach (ITF,
2022). The framework describes how to improve safety across each of the Safe System pillars through the
various key components of a Safe System.

The framework provides a mechanism to help identify the current level of Safe System progress, which can
be applied to a project, region, country, or organisation, as well as to interventions and activities. It can be
tailored to the relevant stage of Safe System development (emerging, advancing, mature). The framework
makes it possible to evaluate the extent to which an existing or planned road-safety project can be
considered to align with the Safe System approach and where there is room for improvement.

The Safe System framework serves several possible purposes:

1. To provide general guidance about interventions that should be considered by countries applying the
Safe System approach, depending on their stage of development.

2. To analyse the Safe System alignment of existing projects or sets of interventions to encourage
improvement by evaluating lessons learned, and collecting information about possible future steps to
enhance effectiveness; and

3. To assess pilots, planned Safe System projects or sets of interventions to help improve their Safe
System content, identify opportunities for improvement and provide guidance to maximise
effectiveness.

The Safe System framework is structured around three dimensions:

1. The five key components of the Safe System.
2. The six traditional pillars of road safety.
3. The three stages of development of any Safe System intervention.

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 53/132



The five key components build on the four fundamental principles of a Safe System by adding institutional
governance as a critical enabler of a Safe System. Institutional government is required to organise
government intervention covering research, funding, legislation, regulation and licencing and requires
mechanisms for coordinating and funding actions as well as maintaining a focus on delivering improved
road safety outcomes.

The Safe System framework is based on a matrix that can be used to describe any example of a Safe
System intervention based on two dimensions: key components and pillars (see Table 4.6). Within such a
matrix it is possible to define the current level of alignment to Safe System for an individual cell or any
combination of cells as well as to evaluate the expected level of progress that would occur through
improvements leading to better Safe System alignment. In each of the cells, improvements in safety can
be made, Safe System principles can be implemented and assessed, and opportunities for improvement
can be identified.

includes five possible stages of Safe System development (see Table 4.7) applicable to any country, region
or city. At one end of the scale, an emerging system combines straightforward interventions and an initial
process of co-operation and integration. At the other, a mature system combines sophisticated
interventions and progress towards an ideal situation. For some countries or cities working towards Safe

advancing stage in other cells.

At a strategic level the framework examines the combination of key components and pillars in terms of a
conceptual alignment with the Safe System. For example, speed limits that aim to prevent exposure to
large forces (refer Cell 4.4 or Table 4.6) are set based on human vulnerability and supported by road
design, enforcement, driver education and vehicle technologies. At an operational level the framework
outlines descriptions of what road-safety situations to expect in each of the three different stages of
development of Safe System implementation. An example three-dimensional framework for Safer Speeds
(refer Cell 4.4 of Table 4.6) is presented in Box 4.4.

4.9 PATHWAY TO SAFE SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION

GETTING STARTED

Understand what a Safe System would look like.

Leadership is critical. Gain commitment from heads of agencies to the adoption and
implementation of the Safe System approach.
Adopt an aspiration for elimination of fatalities and serious injuries in the long-term
(making crashes survivable, working towards zero) and identify what will be required to
achieve this shift in thinking and its progressive implementation.
Conduct a management capacity review and identify an investment plan based on a Safe
System approach.

What are the management capacity and road safety policy deficiencies? What
are the network crash risk problems? What is required to commence the Safe
System journey?
What investment, both initially (a demonstration project for LMICs – see
Chapter 6. Road Safety Targets, Investment Strategies, Plans and Projects ) and
in the medium-term (extending demonstration project learnings to scale in
LMICs – See Chapter 6. Road Safety Targets, Investment Strategies, Plans and
Projects ) is needed?

Plan and design multi-sectoral Safe System demonstration projects. Focus on corridor
action plans and selected national policy reviews with project management and expert
assistance over some years (See Chapter 6. Road Safety Targets, Investment Strategies,
Plans and Projects ). Establish a multi-agency steering committee and a working group for
the project with an agreed lead agency.
Establish a reliable national crash data system.

MAKING PROGRESS
Continue capacity strengthening: Focus on developing institutional arrangements and the
knowledge base of agencies around Safe System approaches to network safety.
Determine what knowledge is needed to analyse current system safety shortcomings
including policy limitations and identify priority interventions necessary to accelerate the
shift towards a Safe System.
For LMICs, implement the demonstration projects.
Monitor, analyse and evaluate to establish what has been learnt from demonstration
corridor projects, plan to extend demonstration project activity across the wider network
and implement higher priority policy review findings.

CONSOLIDATING ACTIVITY
Implement extension of Safe System demonstration projects across the country, based on
the Safe System principles being absorbed and adopted over time within the policies and
approaches adopted by road safety agencies.
Expand agency project oversight roles to whole of country road safety responsibilities.

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 57/132



Benchmark performance against other similar countries.
Extend knowledge development to regional and local governments and communities.
Identify further enabling measures needed nationally, and further Safe System
interventions to be introduced nationally, regionally or locally.
Make use of the ITF - World Bank Safe System Framework to assess existing and planned
Safe System projects or sets of interventions to help improve their alignment with the Safe
System approach and to identify opportunities for improvement.

The following four case studies from New Zealand, Mexico, Paraguay and Slovenia show how each country
is improving road safety. New Zealand uses a Safe System approach, while Mexico, Paraguay and Slovenia
use iRAP to assess the risk on the road network and enable the development of a safety plan and program.

CASE STUDY - New Zealand: Safe System assessment framework

Road agencies in Australia and New Zealand have adopted the Safe System approach and have been
working to implement programmes consistent with achieving Safe System outcomes for more than a
decade. Infrastructure must be planned, implemented and maintained to assist in meeting these
objectives. This includes the need to assess whether infrastructure planned or existing can meet Safe
System objectives. Read more.

CASE STUDY - Mexico: Improving the safety of Mexico's Road Network

As part of one of the largest iRAP assessments in the world, over 65,000 km of road have now been
assessed by SCT in Mexico include before and after star ratings across the whole country. The
assessment included the carrying out of video-based road surveys integrated with asset and
pavement management surveys, star rating the safety of the network to assess the likelihood and
severity of crashes, producing a Safer Roads Investment Plan to allocate resources on
countermeasures and ‘performance tracking’ to assess changes in the Star Rating performance of the
roads over time. Read more.

CASE STUDY - Paraguay: The safety of the road network in Paraguay

Deaths and serious injuries have steadily been increasing in Paraguay, reaching more than 1,300 in
year 2012. As part of the National Road Safety Plan 2008-2013, the Ministerio de Transportes y Obras
Públicas (MTOP), with support from the Inter-American Development Bank, made the decision to
carry out an assessment of 4,000 km of roads in order to understand the road safety situation of the
national network and propose countermeasures to be implemented and improve the road safety

CASE STUDY - Slovenia: Safety ranking Slovenia's road network

AMZS (Slovenian motoring club) supported by Republika Slovenia Ministrstvo za Infrastrukturo in
Prostor, the Slovenian Police service, DARS Povezujemo Slovenijo and Prometnotehniski Institut were
committed to improving the safety of Slovenia’s road network. A large-scale project was rolled out
which involved risk mapping Slovenia’s roads, carrying out video-based road surveys, star rating the
safety of the network to assess the potential for the likelihood and severity of crashes. Read more.

5. EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT AND USE OF SAFETY
DATA

KEY MESSAGES
The establishment and ongoing support of road safety data systems is critical to the
effective management of road safety in all countries.
A lack of accurate data has a serious impact on the effective management and delivery of
positive road safety outcomes. The issue of under-reporting in many countries needs to be
addressed. Guidance is available on how to improve this accuracy.
Safety data is used for identifying the size of the road safety problem, analysis of
problems, development of strategy, identification of solutions, for advocacy, and
monitoring, analysis and evaluation.
Key safety data includes exposure data (e.g. traffic volume, population data), final
outcome data (e.g. deaths and injuries), and intermediate outcome data (e.g. average
speeds, protective equipment fitment and use, level of drinking and driving, network and
vehicle safety quality).
Countries that do not collect this data need to commence this process as a priority. In the
meantime, crash injury and survey data should be collected on high-risk routes (e.g. high
volume roads with a recognised fatal and serious injury problem).
Detailed guidance is available on how to establish and improve crash data systems,
including the assessment of existing data sources, development of a crash report form,
engagement with key stakeholders, development of a crash data system, and ensuring
the quality of this data.
Other data is also important for assessing and addressing road risk. There is an increasing
awareness of the importance of road asset data (information on safety related road and
roadside design elements and features). Where high quality crash data does not exist, this
information can be used to identify and treat high risk locations.
Integration of different sources of safety data can lead to a more comprehensive
understanding of the road safety problem, and a greater ability to put effective actions in
place to address this problem.
Accurate and comprehensive road safety data can be used by many stakeholders to help
improve road safety.

5.1 INTRODUCTION
Comprehensive safety data is required for effective road safety management. Safety data is essential for
an evidence-based approach, particularly in producing results-focused strategies, action programmes and
projects; identifying key crash types and locations; diagnosing the causes of serious and fatal injury in road
traffic crashes; selecting treatments; and monitoring and evaluating progress. The establishment and
support of data systems was specifically identified as part of the Global Plan for the Decade of Action for
Road Safety 2011-2020 with Pillar 1 (Road Safety Management), highlighting the importance of this
activity (UNRSC, 2011).

Crash data is a key type of safety data, which can provide a valuable source of information to assist in
road safety management. However, this is only one type of data required for the effective management of
road safety. Crash data needs to be supplemented by other information, including road inventory and
survey data of key road users’ behaviours, enforcement data, road network and vehicle fleet safety, and
emergency and medical system quality. This data is important in providing intermediate measures of
safety. In LMICs where crash injury databases are not fully established or operational, such survey data is
particularly important for the measurement and targeting of safety problems. Road safety management
capacity reviews in LMICs indicate weak capacity for identification and measurement of road safety
problems. As such, there is a need to build capacity to improve road safety data collection, storage,
analysis and sharing.

According to World Bank Guidelines for Conducting Road Safety Data Reviews (Martensen et al., 2021),
‘Road safety data are not just about crash data (or outcome data – the observed crashes and injuries), but
also about the safety performance of the road traffic system, and about interventions to improve road
safety. These data are best used when combined with other information, such as traffic volumes and
distances travelled, or split between different transport modalities. For an evidence-based approach to the
management of road safety, these data can be used by policy makers, traffic engineers, police, the health
sector, the research community, insurance companies, prosecutors, vehicle manufacturers, and others.’

This chapter provides information on the types of data required to effectively manage safety; the
establishment of data systems; and the collection and use of this data. It also provides guidance on
combining the different types of safety data to manage road safety more effectively.

Uses of this data can be found throughout this manual, including on:

Target setting and performance indicators (Chapter 6. Road Safety Targets, Investment
Strategies Plans and Projects).
Assessing risk and potential solutions (Chapter 10. Assessing Potential Risks and Identifying
Issues).
Intervention selection and prioritisation (Chapter 11. Intervention Selection and Prioritisation ).
Monitoring, analysis and evaluation (Chapter 12. Monitoring, Analysis and Evaluation of Road
Safety).

Much of this chapter discusses the effective management of safety data at network level (e.g. for the
whole country). However, it is recognised that establishment of a national data source (although essential)
may be some way off for some countries. At the very least, the information in this chapter should be used
to commence the collection of data on high-risk routes, including through corridor and area demonstration
projects (see Chapter 6. Road Safety Targets, Investment Strategies Plans and Projects).

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 64/132



As indicated elsewhere in this manual, the focus for effective road safety management is on the
elimination of death and serious injury (both of which are defined in Section 5.2 Identifying Data
Requirements), and this is also where greatest efforts should be made in the collection of safety data.
Information on fatal and serious injuries, and the crash types (such as those identified in Chapter 4. The
Safe System Approach ) and factors that lead to such injuries, should form the highest priority in data
collection. However, there are also important uses for data on minor injuries and even non-injury crashes,
and such information should also be collected where possible.

HOW DO I GET STARTED?
Countries must assess what safety-related information they already collect, who the key stakeholders
(collectors and users) are, how this data is used, and what further information is required. Section 5.2
Identifying Data Requirements and Section 5.3 Establishing and Maintaining Crash Data Systems
discuss these issues.

Countries must commence collection of ‘final outcome’ injury data (especially fatal and serious injury
data). Initially this may come from high-risk routes or corridors (usually high-volume national roads).
This is discussed in Section 5.3 Establishing and Maintaining Crash Data Systems .

Countries must also start collecting ‘intermediate outcome’ data or information on performance
indicators (see Section 5.2 Identifying Data Requirements ). Information on road and roadside
elements is a high priority and can be used to identify problems and solutions, even in the absence of
detailed crash data (see Section 5.4 Non-Crash Data and Recording Systems ). Other intermediate
data includes compliance data (such as speed, drink-driving and helmet wearing rates. This data can
be used to identify issues and solutions, as well as in the broader management of road safety
outcomes.

5.2 IDENTIFYING DATA REQUIREMENTS
There are a wide variety of uses for safety data, with many different users. As identified later in Section 5.6
Analysis and Use of Data to Improve Safety , safety data can be used by policymakers, traffic engineers,
police, the health sector, the research community, insurance companies, prosecutors, vehicle
manufacturers and others. Although summary data (particularly on crash fatalities) is available in most
countries, more detailed information is required to fulfil the requirements of these users. Without this
collection of data, it is not possible to take an evidence-based approach to the management of road safety.

WHO (2010) provides discussion on the use of data for a public health approach to road safety. This
document provides a comprehensive account of crash data systems, including their place in effective road
safety management, and their establishment and use. It is essential reading on this topic, particularly for
those working within LMICs who wish to establish or improve upon a crash data system. This document
suggests a cyclic approach of:

Using data to define problems.
Identifying risk factors and priorities.
Developing strategy.
Setting targets and monitoring performance.

This process is then repeated.

WHO (2010) also provides guidance on the linkage between safety data and effective safety management
(Figure 5.1), giving a framework for the collection and use of this data. The WHO document makes it clear
that crash data alone is not sufficient to manage safety, but rather it must be used in combination with
other sources of information. This additional information is required to better interpret risks, thereby
assisting in the monitoring of performance and achievement of results.

FIGURE 5.1: DATA REQUIREMENTS FOR ROAD SAFETY MANAGEMENT (SOURCE: ADAPTED FROM WHO,
2010)

As identified in Figure 5.1 and Box 5.1 (and further discussed in WHO, 2010; Bliss & Breen, 2009, 2013),
the desired results or outcomes of road safety management are expressed as goals and targets, and occur
at a number of different but related levels. These include institutional outputs from the policies,
programmes and projects that have been implemented, which influence a range of intermediate
outcomes. These intermediate outcomes subsequently influence final outcomes. Ultimately, these should
reduce fatal and serious injury, in alignment with Safe System outcomes.

BOX 5.1: EXAMPLE SAFETY DATA RELATING TO ROAD SAFETY MANAGEMENT

Final outcomes: Outcome indicators may include the number of fatalities and serious injuries, crashes
relating to certain road users (e.g. pedestrians, motorcyclists) or types (e.g. intersection, head-on),
crash rates (e.g. crashes per population, vehicle registrations, or amount of travel)

Intermediate outcomes: Safety performance indicators may include behavioural measures such as
average vehicle speed, drink-driving, helmet wearing rates, seatbelt wearing, attitude survey
information; vehicle safety ratings; infrastructure measures, including road safety ratings, % of high
volume high speed roads that are divided by a median, % of roads where pedestrians are present with
adequate footpaths; and post-crash care indicators such as emergency vehicle response times.

Outputs: Process/implementation indicators may include the policies, plans or programmes that have
been implemented and details of this implementation (e.g. campaigns to promote seatbelt use, hours of

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 67/132



additional speed enforcement, investment in safe road infrastructure, number of new ambulances).

For example, analysis of data may have identified vehicle speed as a risk factor. A policy to improve
compliance with speed limits will require an increase in speed enforcement. The output results of this
intervention would be evidence of this increase in enforcement. Intermediate outcome measures might
include the percentage of drivers exceeding the speed limit at selected locations. Changes in this measure
(i.e. a reduction in speeding motorists) would help identify whether the intervention is having the desired
effect. The final outcome indicators would include total deaths and serious injuries (ideally including a
record of those that were identified as being speed-related), proving the ultimate benefit of this
intervention.

Although crash data is a primary source of safety-related information, other data sources also serve a very
important role (see Section 5.4 Non-Crash Data and Recording Systems ). There is growing recognition of
the use of asset data (including road design features) in road safety, and in many cases this information
may already be collected and available for use. As identified later in this chapter, many countries do not
have accurate information on crashes, and until such data is available, information about road design
features and key safety behaviours provides an important means of identifying high risk locations and
ways to address them.

Often different sources of information will be available on similar issues. Although multiple sources of
information can be useful to help understand road safety issues more fully, it can also lead to confusion if
the sources provide conflicting information. Differences can result from inaccuracies in data or differences
in how the data is collected (see Section 5.5 Data Quality and Under-Reporting for further discussion of
these issues). Where there is potential for confusion from the use of multiple sources of information, it is
important to select a ‘single source of truth’ from a data source that will ultimately inform decision-
making. Once this source of information is selected, justification needs to be provided as to why this
source is preferred.

Different terms for injury severity are included throughout this manual. Definitions for different types of
injury are provided in Box 5.2.

BOX 5.2: DEFINITIONS FOR DIFFERENT INJURY LEVELS

Fatal injury: any person killed immediately or dying within 30 days as a result of a road traffic injury
crash, excluding suicides.

Serious injury: Injury that requires admission to hospital for at least 24 hours, or specialist attention,
such as fractures, concussions, severe shock and severe lacerations. Some countries have adopted the
Maximum Abbreviated Injury Scale (MAIS), and suggested that serious injury be defined as MAIS3+.

Other/minor injury: Injury that requires little or no medical attention (e.g. sprains, bruises, superficial
cuts and scratches).

Property damage/non-injury: No injury is sustained as a result of the crash but there is damage to
vehicles and/or property.

5.3 ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING CRASH
DATA SYSTEMS
This section provides guidance on the establishment and maintenance of crash data systems. Information
on the collection and use of other sources of data can be found in the following sections. Full details on the
establishment and maintenance of crash data systems can be found in WHO (2010). The following is a
summary of key issues.

SOURCES OF CRASH DATA
Identified effective practice acknowledges that no single crash injury database will provide enough
information to give a complete picture of road traffic injuries or to fully understand the underlying injury
mechanisms (IRTAD, 2011). A number of countries which have improved their road safety performance use
both crash injury data collected by the police as well as health sector data.

National crash data are typically collected by police (WHO (2023) reports that over 70% of countries use
police data as the primary source), and entered into crash database systems for easy analysis and annual
reporting. In some circumstances, data are collected from hospitals, or from both of these sources. The use
of health sector data for meaningful injury classification at country level is necessary to complement police
data and to provide an optimal means of defining serious injury. IRTAD (2011) recommends that police
data should remain the primary source of road crash statistics, but that this should be complemented by
hospital data due to data quality issues and to identify levels of under-reporting (see Section 5.4 Non-
Crash Data and Recording Systems ). Furthermore, in-depth data is needed from crash injury research to
lead to meaningful conclusions concerning crash and injury causation.

NATIONAL POLICE-REPORTED CRASH DATA
The police are well placed to collect information on crashes as they are often called to the scene.
Alternatively, they may receive information about the crash following the event. Attendance at the crash
scene allows for collection of detailed information that is useful for identifying crash causes and possible
solutions.

A crash report form is typically completed to document the detail of a crash. These forms can be a
traditional papers-based form or computer-based systems like:

Portable computers: that can enhance the legibility of crashes reports, reduce input errors, and ease the
workload on report-processing personnel. However, they may increase the burden on police officers at the
scene, where they should be ensuring safety and minimizing road closures. To address this, it is crucial to
optimize the interface capabilities of portable computers, allowing officers to complete reports efficiently
and reduce the time spent on data entry at crashes scenes.

FIGURE 5.2: COMPUTERIZED CRASH REPORT FROM (SOURCE: SÛRETÉ DU QUÉBEC)



Pen-based computers: (or clipboard computers) permit data entry in the old-fashioned way (pen and
form), while their character or pattern recognition features convert marks made on an electronic screen
table into recognizable characters, thus generating an electronic database at the same time. Customized
software can be developed specifically to assist in the completion of crash report forms.

Palmtop computers: are ideal for simple data collection tasks, using either a pen-based screen or a
small keyboard. Palmtop computers may be very useful in police cars, where they can be mounted on the
dashboard, taking up little space.

Magnetic stripe: systems work by using a magnetic field to record data as magnetic signals (called flux
reversals) on a magnetic strip, similar to what’s used in audio or video tapes. When read by a decoder,
these signals are converted into letters and numbers. A magnetic stripe can store a decent amount of
data-about 120 bytes.

Bar codes: consist of black and white patterns that represent letters or numbers, allowing officers to
quickly scan and retrieve vehicle and driver information, reducing transcription errors. These barcodes can
be found on vehicle labels, registration certificates, and driver’s licenses, and can include details like
vehicle type, safety features, and even the license photograph.

Radio frequency: modems can be used to relay digital data communication between a portable
computer and a mainframe computer. A police officer may retrieve data on a vehicle or its owner within
seconds by simply entering the licence plate data into a portable computer or terminal carried in the patrol

car. Electronic report forms can be forwarded by modem to a data centre.

‘Smart’ cards are electronic cards, similar to credit cards, that store and transmit information. Smart
cards could be used to store all vehicle status and operational data.

Digital cameras can produce excellent-quality pictures in digitized format, which can then be copied into
a computer and easily attached to a crash database or electronic report form. Digital cameras are useful
tools for an investigating police officer.

At a crash location, collecting crash data is not the only task of police officers, they have also to secure the
site, care for injured persons and re-establish traffic flow. On-scene data collection systems must consider
the officers needs and work constraints when implementing new technologies. Expert systems developed
for crash data collection can ease the workload of police officers on-site in addition to increasing the
accuracy and consistency of reported data. Expert systems are computer programs that contain
knowledge in a specific field. While collecting the necessary information on the circumstances of a crash, a
police officer has to make certain judgments such as: Did the driver/passengers really wear their safety
belts as stated? What is the extent of vehicle damage? How should the severity of the crash be classified?
Answering these and other questions not only takes valuable time at the scene but may also lead to
inconsistent statistics as officers may judge situations differently. Expert systems can embed rules that
help police officers in providing more accurate answers to such questions. Such systems also allow them to
collect both state-required data and specific pieces of information that are particularly relevant to a given
road context (e.g. roadside conditions in the case of a single vehicle crash or lighting conditions in the case
of a night crash).

Key variables typically collected include:

Crash location (including geographic coordinates).
Time of day, day of week, month of year, year.
Information on those who were involved (including road user type, age, gender, injury
sustained).
Details regarding the road (whether at an intersection, speed limit, curvature, traffic control,
markings).
Details on the environment (light conditions, weather, road surface wet or dry).
Information regarding what happened in the crash (vehicle movement types, objects struck
(including off-road), and contributory factors such as speed, alcohol use or driver distraction).
Vehicle factors (type of vehicles involved).

Examples of crash report forms, including the types of detail that should be collected as a minimum can be
found in WHO (2010). The advice provided in the WHO document is based on the European Common
Accident Dataset (CADaS). Similarly, the World Bank Guidelines for Conducting Road Safety Data Reviews
(Martensen et al., 2021) refer to a set of 28 road crash attributes derived from CADaS. In addition, a
number of countries have developed their own minimum criteria. For example, the US has a Model
Minimum Uniform Crash Criteria (NHTSA, 2025).

A balance needs to be reached between collecting the required information, and the time it takes to
perform this task. If too much burden is placed on the police, it is less likely that the crash report form will
be completed. Police are key stakeholders in the establishment and continued collection and use of crash
data and should be included at each stage of the process.

Others modern technology may help to collect data in case of crashes:

Crash data recorder

In crash investigations, the absence of traditional evidence like skid marks can complicate the process of
determining what actions the driver took before the crash. But modern vehicles equipped with Anti-lock
Braking Systems (ABS) can prevent visible skid marks from appearing on the road surface. As a result,
investigators may lack critical visual clues. To overcome this challenge, Accident Data Recorders (ADRs) or
‘black boxes’ are increasingly used in vehicles, much like flight recorders in airplanes. These devices
capture and store crucial data about the vehicle's behaviour just before and during a crash. The data
recorded can include:

capture and store crucial data about the vehicle's behaviour just before and during a crash. The data
recorded can include:

Transversal and longitudinal acceleration: Measures the speed changes of vehicle along
different axes, which can help understand the vehicle's movement and forces during the crash.
Speed: Gives the exact speed at the moment of or just before the collision.
Vehicle rotation: Captures the angular momentum of vehicle, indicating if and how the vehicle
spun or rolled.
Skidding: Tracks if the vehicle entered a skid, which could indicate loss of traction or control.
Activation of ignition, lights, flashers, and brakes: Monitors whether critical vehicle systems
were engaged or disabled at the time of the crash.

The crash recognition is fully automatic, and the data are recorded with precision from 30 seconds before
until 15 seconds after the crash. The device can be installed in any kind of vehicle and is able to store data
for more than one crash.

FIGURE 5.3: EXAMPLE OF AUTOMATIC DATA RECORD



Photogrammetric measurement

This involves taking a standard set of pictures of the exterior and interior of the vehicle with specially
adapted small-format cameras. The pictures are then used to create three-dimensional images. Fieldwork
is completed in a few minutes. Evaluation is done separately using the data collection and involves experts
when needed. This device can be used to determine the efficiency of restraint equipment.

HOSPITAL DATA
Hospital data is used to identify levels of under-reporting or to obtain better injury information, particularly
when police report data is not available or is inadequate. IRTAD (2011) suggests that because of under-
reporting of crash data, hospital data should also be collected and is the next most useful source of
information for crash statistics.

Encouraged by the WHO and other institutions, medical authorities have established international
recording systems that include road traffic injury. In particular, the International Classification of Diseases
and related Health Problems (ICD) and the Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) coding systems are used widely.
IRTAD (2011) recommend that an internationally agreed definition of ‘serious’ injury be developed, and
that the Maximum Abbreviated Injury Scale (MAIS) be used as the basis for defining crash injury severity.
This scale is based on maximum injury severity for any of nine parts of the body. A score of 3 or greater for
one or more regions of the body (MAIS3+) is recommended as the point at which an injury is considered to
be serious. An example of the use GIS analysis and hospital data from Thailand is provided below.

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 73/132



CASE STUDY - Thailand: Khon Kaen Province: GIS spatial analysis of hospital data

Although information on crashes existed from other sources, it was not sufficient to adequately
manage safety in Khon Kaen province, Thailand. An alternative source of information existed from
hospital data, but this did not provide information on crash locations. Khon Kaen Regional Hospital in
the northeast of Thailand has had its own Trauma Registry since 1989 and added additional
information on road crashes through the use of an ‘Accident Report’ form and also developed GIS
mapping. This information has allowed detailed analysis of crash data, including the identification of
high risk locations. A number of detailed studies on specific road safety issues have been undertaken
over recent years based on this rich source of information. Read More.

A further example is provided in the case study from Egypt, demonstrating the integration of data from
different sources, as well as the use of this data by various key stakeholders.

CASE STUDY - Egypt: EU twinning project on enhancing road safety

The need for a centralised and accurate accident data system occurred in Egypt. The National
Accident Management system is intended to be built as a new system for both investigating and
analysing road crash data and it is intended as a shared ‘space’ for all parties responding to different
kinds of road crashes, such as medical rescue services, police forces, fire brigades, hospital personnel
and the road administration. The main outcome was that underreporting was successfully diminished
and a close cooperation between the key stakeholders and a detailed system of information for crash
investigations was achieved. Read More.

REGISTRATION SYSTEMS
‘Vital registration’ data can be used as a source of information on road deaths. This information comes
from death certificates completed by doctors which state the cause of death. WHO (2010) reports that
around 40% of WHO member countries collect vital registration data of the detail required for monitoring
road traffic deaths. WHO and other organizations have instituted an international registration system that
includes those injured in traffic crashes.

OTHER CRASH DATA SOURCES
Other sources of data on crashes can come from emergency services, tow truck drivers, members of the
public, insurance companies, etc. However, it is important to recognise that the quality and extent of this
information may be limited when compared to police and hospital reported data.

ESTABLISHING OR IMPROVING CRASH DATABASES
Before establishing a new crash database system (or improving a current system), it is recommended that
a situational assessment be undertaken (WHO, 2010 and Martensen et al., 2021). This involves:

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 74/132



Stakeholder analysis.
Assessment of data sources and existing systems/quality.
End user needs assessment.
Environmental analysis.

These same steps are also required when establishing or improving on the collection of non-crash data
(see Section 5.4 Non-Crash Data and Recording Systems ).

A stakeholder analysis involves identifying organisations and individuals who have (or should have) a role
in the collection and use of road safety data. Critical stakeholders will include police, transport agencies
and health departments, but there are likely to be many others.

An assessment of data sources is required to determine what information is already collected, and the
quality of the data. This is often a significant problem in many countries.

An end user assessment involves understanding who the key users are and, how these key stakeholders
use the information. This knowledge will help improve the usability of the data.

An environmental analysis involves understanding the political environment and critical partnerships
required for the successful collection, analysis and use of the data. Without this understanding and
appropriate collaboration, it is likely that collection and use of crash data will be severely hindered. There
are many examples where expensive crash data systems have been established, but data has not been
entered into the system due to inadequate communications and poor cooperation.

Following this situational assessment, the recommended process for establishing a crash database system
is to:

Establish a working group (typically drawn from the stakeholder analysis).
Choose a course of action.
Recommend minimum data elements and definitions.
Design and implement the system (or improve the current system) (WHO, 2010).

Crash location is a key element in collecting and analysing data, particular for road engineers. Without this
information, it is not possible to determine what locations to treat in the future. In addition, if the crash
location is known (whether from police reports or other sources of data), there is potential to link this crash
data to asset or other data sources (see Section 5.6 Analysis and Use of Data to Improve Safety ). This
information may be of use in identifying other road-based elements that may have contributed to the
crash risk.

Several methods are available for the accurate location of crashes, including the use of global positioning
systems, reference to a local landmark (e.g. a link-node system), or reference to a route kilometre marker
post (a linear referencing system).

Historically, crash data records were kept in paper-based filing systems, but now computerised database
systems are used to store information on crashes. This allows relatively easy analysis of data, and is
particularly useful in the identification of trends, high risk locations or areas, key crash types, etc. There
are a number of computer software packages available for this task. At a minimum, such a system should
have the capacity to:

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 75/132



Produce quick summaries on key crash variables (e.g. total crashes; crashes by different
severity; crashes by different user groups, such as pedestrians; trends over time).
Allow cross-tabulations (i.e. analysis of two or more variables at a time (e.g. change in fatal
pedestrian crashes over time).
Identify hazardous locations (e.g. locations, routes or areas with concentrations of crashes, or
crashes of a particular type).

Crash data systems have become very advanced in recent years, with features added that allow quicker
and more useful analysis. WHO (2010) and Turner & Hore-Lacy (2010) provide a list of other desirable
features of crash data systems. These include:

Built-in quality checks (algorithms and logic checks).
GIS linkage to allow accurate identification of crash location.
Ability to add new data fields without re-developing the database.
Database navigation features such as drop-down menus, clickable maps.
Pre-defined queries and reports.
Options for customised, user-defined queries and reports.
Mapping ability for data entry, crash selection and presentation of aggregated crash
information.
Ability to export data to third-party applications (e.g. Microsoft Excel, Statistical Analysis
Software (SAS)) for further statistical analysis.
Inclusion of crash narrative, sketches of crash scene, photographs and videos linked to crash.
Automatically generated collision diagrams.
Site ranking based on crash rates, numbers, costs.
Ability to monitor sites of interest, i.e. before and after treatments.

An example of the successful implementation of a crash data system is provided in the case study below
from Cambodia.

CASE STUDY - Cambodia, Road Crash Victim and Information System

The database system for Cambodia was inadequate to manage effective road safety outcomes. Since
2002, three different ministries were involved in road crash data collection in Cambodia (Ministry of
Public Works and Transport, Ministry of Interior (MoI), and Ministry of Health (MoH)). While these
databases provided some relevant information on the road safety, improvement was needed as the
databases were not compatible and had major discrepancies between them. Handicap International
Belgium and the Cambodian Red Cross proposed a new system, based on a standardised and more
detailed data collection form. The new system provides accurate, continuous and comprehensive
information on road crashes and victims for the purposes of increasing understanding of the road
safety situation, planning appropriate responses, and evaluating impact of the road safety initiatives.
Combining both data sources has enabled the system to cover more elements on detailed crash
information (from police) and casualty information (from hospitals). This has led to higher levels of
reporting. Read More.

The Swedish Strada system is a unique database that integrates police and hospital data. It is important to
recognise that although this linkage provides valuable additional information, it does occur at additional
cost. Further details are provided in the Swedish case study.

CASE STUDY - Sweden: Swedish traffic accident data acquisition (STRADA)

In October 1996 the Swedish Road Administration was commissioned by the Swedish government to
initiate a new information system covering injuries and accidents in the entire road traffic system.
Strada is based on information reported from two sources: the Swedish police and hospitals. By
bringing together data from two sources – the police and the hospitals – Strada provides more
detailed information, thus increasing the knowledge of road traffic injuries and accidents. Read More.

Some countries have undertaken in-depth studies of serious crashes to provide a more thorough
understanding of crash causation factors and possible solutions. Such studies typically investigate a
sample of high severity crashes. As an example, in the UK, the ‘On the Spot’ project collected detailed and
high-quality crash information over two regions. More than 2000 variables were collected for each incident
based on scene investigation soon after the crash occurred, as well as follow-up communication with
medical services and local government. The information was analysed to provide insight about human
involvement, vehicle design, and highway design in crash and injury causation. Mansfield et al. (2008)
provide an initial analysis of around 2000 incidents from this program. Such investigation can provide far
more detail than what is typically available through a crash report, and to a higher degree of reliability.

Similar examples can be found in many other countries, including the USA, Germany, France, Malaysia,
India and Australia. Some of these programmes have been in place for many years and have produced
large amounts of valuable information. One of the key outputs from the EU DaCoTA project (which
collected and analysed data from European countries on various road safety topics) was guidance on the
collection of such data, as well as standardised procedures (Thomas et al., 2013). A Pan-European In-depth
Accident Investigation Network has been established, and tools such as an online manual for in-depth road
crash investigations have been developed (see DaCoTa ).

The US has established the second Strategic Highway Research Program (SHRP2). SHRP2 is perhaps the
most comprehensive database of information on factors occurring before and during crashes and near-
crash events. The information collected includes data from the Naturalistic Driving Study (NDS) database.
This dataset includes information from over 2300 drivers, collected through equipment installed in their
own vehicles, and through normal driving. The massive amount of data collected through the NDS is
supplemented through the Roadway Information Database (RID) which includes comprehensive
information on road elements in the study areas as well as other relevant data (including crash data). This
globally significant database is expected to provide the research basis for studies on driver performance
and behaviour.

UDRIVE is the first large-scale European naturalistic driving study using cars, trucks and powered-two
wheelers. The acronym stands for ‘European naturalistic Driving and Riding for Infrastructure & Vehicle
safety and Environment’. Whilst road transport is necessary for the exchange of goods and people. There
are significant negative consequences to road safety and the environment. To meet EU Target crashes and
vehicle emissions will need to be reduced, with new approaches to achieve these targets developed. It is

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 77/132



the aim of UDRIVE to provide a better understanding road user behaviour leading to crashes and wasted
vehicle emissions.

DATA SHARING
Sharing of data from different sources is required for the comprehensive collection, analysis and
integration of data. Efficient data sharing, particularly between the police and the highway authority, is
essential for good practice road safety management.

However, it is important to note that some organisations may be reluctant to share certain data,
particularly personal identifiers, due to the issues it poses surrounding the privacy and anonymity of those
involved. One response is to collect the personal details on a separate page of the crash report form (e.g.
name and address information). This page can then be removed before sending the remaining pages on to
partner agencies. In some cases, it may be necessary to develop appropriate privacy policies to ensure
this issue is addressed, or for certain variables to be removed to prevent the identification of individuals.

Crash data on its own is a valuable source of information on crash risk, and when combined with other
sources of data, this value can be greatly increased.

Crash data is highly valuable for various stakeholders:

Traffic engineers: They can use this data to identify and address hazardous conditions on
existing roads and prevent similar issues when designing new roads.
Police forces: Crash data helps law enforcement in planning their activities and concentrating
on high-risk locations and traffic situations.
Researchers: They utilize this information to conduct studies on crash prevention, make
recommendations to improve safety at similar sites, and propose restrictive measures for
specific road users, such as graduated driver licensing for young drivers.
Policy-makers: They rely on this data to set crash reduction goals and develop road safety
action plans at national, regional, and local levels based on safety analysis findings.
Prosecutors: They use crash-related information, including eyewitness statements, police
reports, and evidence provided by the parties involved.
Insurance companies: This data helps insurers determine premiums and rates based on
factors like driving history, vehicle type, safety measures, and risks posed by specific road
networks.
Vehicle manufacturers: They use crash data to design and produce safer vehicles.

Other user groups at both national and local levels make use of crash data occasionally or frequently.
These include politicians, decision-makers, civilian agencies, education boards and the press. These groups
play a key role in keeping the public informed about road safety and highlighting the need for preventive
actions.

The following section discusses some of the other data sources, while Section 5.6 Analysis and Use of Data
to Improve Safety discusses combining these sources.

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 78/132



5.4 NON-CRASH DATA AND RECORDING SYSTEMS
Crash data is generally considered a key source of information when assessing and treating risk. However,
in some countries, particularly LMICs, crash data may not be reliable or available at all. Additional surveys
and data sources other than crash data may be the only reliable source of safety data available. As
discussed in Identifying Data Requirements, this additional information (safety performance indicators) is
also important in road safety management. These enable assessment of different policies, programmes
and projects to identify their effect on road safety outcomes. This occurs through the collection and
assessment of details on the interventions implemented and the intermediate outcomes.

A variety of other data sources are available, including information on road design and features, traffic
data, survey data and exposure data.

ADDITIONAL SOURCES OF INFORMATION
ROAD INVENTORY

Road inventory data are a major source of information that can assist in assessing safety. Because the
impact of different road elements is well known, different elements or combinations of elements can
provide vital insight into crash problems, including the key crash types contributing to fatal and serious
injury outcomes (see Chapter 4. The Safe System Approach ). The following data are of particular use:

Road class – e.g. freeway, arterial, local road.
Road width and type – divided (plus width and type of median) or undivided.
Adjacent land use – e.g. residential, commercial.
Lane number and widths – in each direction.
Intersection or crossing type – cross or ‘T’ intersection, roundabout, railway or other.
Traffic control devices – signals, stop signs, give way signs.
Road alignment – horizontal and vertical alignment.
Street lighting.
Road surface – type (asphalt, concrete, brick, unpaved) and condition (roughness, potholes,
skid resistance).
Shoulders – width, type (paved, unpaved).
Speed limit.
Drainage (surface drainage, sewage system).
Road lighting type, location (above the roadway, one or both the side(s) of the road).
Roadside hazards – including distance to hazard and type.
Pedestrian facilities – including presence of footpath, pedestrian crossing and type.

This presents a basic list of relevant road element types, but there are many other factors that may have
an influence on safety outcomes. The International Road Assessment Programme (iRAP) collects around 70
attributes (see iRAP methodology for details of these attributes, and Section 10.4 Proactive Identification
for more information on iRAP, and Box for examples of the data collection undertaken in Mexico). In the
United States, the Model Inventory of Roadway Elements (MIRE) provides a list of 202 elements that may
be needed for making road safety decisions.

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 79/132



Road features need to be spatially located (ideally through a GIS-based system) to allow effective analysis
and cross-linkage.

Road inventory data relevant to road safety may already exist (e.g. through road asset database systems)
or it might need to be collected. A situational assessment should be performed to see whether this data
exists (see Section 5.3 Establishing and Maintaining Crash Data Systems ). Road inventory data has
traditionally been used for road safety audit or inspection (see Chapter 10. Assessing Potential Risks and
Identifying Issues ), but in more recent times, methods have been developed to quantify the likely safety
outcomes based on these elements. The case study below shows Mexico's efforts to collect data on 46,000
km of its Federal Highways.

CASE STUDY - Mexico: Road Safety Data Collection

Nationally, Mexico has about 18,000 deaths in road accidents per year, with an annual average
growth of 1.9%. Of these deaths, 25% occur in the Federal Highway Network, which constitutes the
backbone of the road and national transportation system. Mexico launched a preventative project
aimed at assessing 46,000 km of Federal Highways during a first stage in 2012 and 19,000 km of
collector roads during a second stage in 2013. The project, in each of its two stages, made it possible
to generate a safety rating for each type of road user and the investment plan at 20 years for safer
roads. Read More.

The collection of this data can be based on ad hoc approaches (e.g. through periodic inspection, public
complaints, etc.), but should ideally be through a comprehensive programme conducted on a regular
basis. The most common approach involves the collection of data through video images, and subsequent
rating or coding of this data by trained experts. This information is then fed into a database or asset
register (see Box 5.3).

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 80/132




BOX 5.3 COLLECTION AND RATING OF SAFETY DATA THROUGH VIDEO IMAGES

Although the collection of road inventory data is highly useful, it needs to be done in a way that
minimises costs (i.e. it must be quick), it must be accurate, and it must be safe. Several methods for
data collection are available. In the most basic technique, data can be recorded on data collection
sheets while travelling along the road of interest. This approach can only really be used on relatively
short lengths, and it can be difficult to collect all relevant road variables when travelling at normal
traffic speed.

For more extensive data gathering, computer-aided collection can be undertaken using a tablet or
laptop, or information can be collected via video and coded safely back in the office. With a tablet,
information is added to a database while travelling along the road of interest. Touch screen technology
is typically used to select relevant road variables. Different symbols may be displayed on screen to
facilitate quick data entry. As mentioned earlier, it is often difficult to enter all relevant variables when
travelling at high speeds or in busy environments, and so video is often recorded to assist in later data
entry and checking.

Another option involves the desktop assessment of video data. One or more video cameras can be used
to collect data along the network of interest. A single camera can be used to gather information in a
forward direction. Alternatively, more cameras can be used to allow better collection of road and
roadside information. This video imagery is then used to code the variables of interest. The video
images can be calibrated to allow measurement for more accurate collection of information (such as
road width or distance to roadside hazards) and to ensure accurate spatial location of assets.

Video images are assessed and can be paused to study more complex environments. Information from
the images is added to a database for later analysis. This data entry may be through a dropdown menu
system or manual population of a database. Data is typically collected for a discrete length of road (e.g.
a 10 m section).

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 81/132



FIGURE 5.4: POPULATING A DATAVASE WITH SAFETY-RELATED INVENTORY DATA

New technologies are being developed that will assist in more automated collection of road and roadside
data. As an example, it is possible to collect information on features such as road width, horizontal and
vertical alignment, and road surface condition using Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and other vehicle
sensors.

TRAFFIC DATA

Traffic data is important to collect and analyse, particularly traffic volumes (or Average Annual Daily
Traffic, AADT). This data can be used to generate crash rates, which provide a good indication of safety
performance, including the safety performance of specific routes, road types or even infrastructure
elements. Other types of traffic data include the traffic mix (e.g. percentage of different vehicle type;
motorcyclists, bicyclists and pedestrians) and vehicle speeds (mean and 85th percentile speeds,
compliance with speed limits). Traffic data can be collected using manual traffic counts or through
automated means (see: Technical Study Traffic Count ).

OTHER EXPOSURE DATA

Aside from traffic data, other sources of exposure data include population data (total number of people;
number by each age group) for an area or country. This data is typically available from national census
data. Vehicle registration data is also often collected and used.

ATTITUDE SURVEY DATA

Attitude surveys collect information on the views of drivers, other road users and residents. This
information is considered an important source of feedback for assessing the effectiveness of a new
programme or treatment and can provide insight into driver’s behaviour (for example, low compliance
levels with the posted speed limit).

ENFORCEMENT DATA

Information on the number of police checks (e.g. for speed, alcohol, restraint use), number of violations
(e.g. number of vehicles speeding; motorcycle riders without helmets), and number of drivers punished
(e.g. fined, penalties provided or imprisoned) are all useful measures. These will help assess the impact of
new policies or actions on safety outcomes.

In addition to the data sources mentioned above, other useful information can be gathered from the
following sources, where available:

Hospital files – an additional source of information on crashes other than police files, which
provides more detailed information on the injuries sustained, the length of stay in hospital, etc.
(see Section 5.3 Establishing and Maintaining Crash Data Systems for further detail).
Maintenance and operations files – information on the type and timing of any maintenance or
operations work.
Expenditure data – information relating to spending on safety-related initiatives.
Project history files – information relating to any previous major corrective works, including
safety infrastructure improvements.

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 82/132



Insurance company data – crash history of the driver and the car.
Weather reports.
Vehicle data, including information from periodic vehicle inspection.

Other types of compliance data are discussed in the following section.

ADDITIONAL SURVEY METHODS
Often traffic data and driver behaviour data are not readily available. There is no set list of additional data
that must be collected and, given the cost of any type of data collection, careful thought needs to be given
to this task, regardless of whether this is conducted at national level or for specific locations. Additional
data should be collected when there is a need for it, and collection of this data should be cost-effective.

A spot speed survey involves the collection of a sample of speeds at a specific road location, or at a
number of locations. This can then be used to determine the speed distribution of vehicles, which is useful
for the following reasons:

MEASURING SPEEDS AND TRAFFIC VOLUMES

A spot speed survey involves the collection of a sample of speeds at a specific road location, or at a
number of locations. This can then be used to determine the speed distribution of vehicles, which is useful
for the following reasons:

Establishing the speed of vehicles (e.g. mean and 85th percentile speed) on the selected road.
Checking the proportion of vehicles that are travelling over the speed limit.
Assessing the likely contribution of vehicle speeds to crashes.
Checking for differences in speeds between different road users.
Tracking these speeds for monitoring purposes.
Evaluating the effectiveness of a new treatment installed to reduce speeds.

Vehicle speeds can be measured using manual methods (radar or laser guns, stopwatch), or using
automatic methods (loops or tubes). Automatic methods are better for studies that require a larger
sample. Loops and tubes can also record more than just average speeds, such as traffic volumes, vehicle
turning movements and traffic mix. These components are essential to understanding the safety issues
that exist at a location. The GRSP Speed Manual (GRSP & IFRC, 2023) and the UK government (Department
for Transport, 2006) provide in-depth guides to speed and volume measurements and how to manage
speed-related safety issues. See case study on data speed collection in India.

CASE STUDY - India: Speed Data Collection

Data was required on vehicle speeds for a study in four states in India. On-site traffic speed, traffic
volume and crash data on four sample sites were selected from the road corridors that formed part of
the 2011 Four States Project in India. The research team conducted traffic operating speed and
volume studies for determining the 85th percentile speed and the traffic density on the corridors by
type of vehicle. Read More.

MEASURING SEATBELT AND CRASH HELMET USAGE

WHO has published two separate manuals, one dedicated to seatbelts and child restraints (FIA, 2009) and
the other dedicated to helmets (WHO, 2023). Each of the manuals provides information on how to assess
the extent of non-seatbelt and non-helmet use in a project region, as well as how to design, implement
and evaluate a programme to target these issues. With regard to measuring seatbelt and helmet usage,
the guides list possible sources of this information, as well as how to collect the data through conducting
community surveys and observational studies.

MEASURING DRINK-DRIVING LEVELS

Much like measuring helmet and seatbelt usage, GRSP has developed a road safety manual for drink-
driving (GRSP/IFRC, 2022). This provides information on how to assess the situation and choose priority
actions, as well as how to design, implement and evaluate a drinking and driving programme.

The guide suggests collecting data from relevant authorities, such as the police, road authorities and
health sectors, to understand the size of the problem. Data on the level of compliance with existing laws
can be collected through a combination of crash data (i.e. crashes involving drivers and riders with Blood
Alcohol Content (BAC) levels exceeding the legal limit), the number of alcohol offences detected by police,
the percentage of drivers stopped with a BAC over the legal limit, and by performing driver surveys.

There are a variety of other intermediate outcomes that could be measured, depending on the
interventions implemented.

DATA RECORDING SYSTEMS
As for crash data, it is important that survey data be recorded in a way that can be analysed easily. It is
also beneficial for the system to be developed so that data can be linked with other data sources. This is
particularly important for surveys that cover a broad geographic area (such as traffic volume, asset or
population data). Such systems may already exist for this data. A common method is to link data by
location using a Geographic Information System (GIS). These systems can typically store information that
is linked geographically for future analysis. Different types of data can be added to such systems as a
‘layer’, allowing more powerful assessment of risk (see Section 5.6 Analysis and Use of Data to Improve
Safety ).

5.5 DATA QUALITY AND UNDER-REPORTING
When collecting, managing or utilising road safety data, it is important to remember that data quality can
be compromised at any stage of the data process. This can be due to:

Missing or incomplete data, or errors in data collection and entry.
Differences in the application and understanding of variable definitions.
Under-reporting (WHO, 2010).

There are a number of consequences associated with poor data quality and under-reporting of crash data
(Langford, 2005; Derriks & Mak, 2007). Some include:

Lower numbers of casualties will reduce road safety as a public health issue and therefore it will
be less likely to attract funding.
Misleading information may cause road authorities to make ineffective and faulty road safety
decisions and set inappropriate priorities.
The success rates of implemented countermeasures cannot be fully assessed.
Comparisons between jurisdictions and countries cannot be accurately made.

This section will consider factors that affect data quality, as well as methods for studying inconsistencies in
data and how to improve data quality. Although this section concentrates on crash data, quality issues are
also relevant to non-crash data, and care needs to be taken in the collection and interpretation of this.

MISSING OR INCOMPLETE DATA AND ERRORS
Data can sometimes be recorded incorrectly by the police or data entry staff. A major issue to note is that
the person who fills in the form at the scene is, in most instances, not the same person who enters the
data into the database (Derriks & Mak, 2007). Missing, incomplete and incorrect data is often unintentional
and is the result of human error. Due to officer priorities and workloads, the police cannot always attend
the scene of a crash or may not have the time to completely fill out the crash report (which can be made
worse by unnecessarily long data collection forms). Unclear variable definitions, as discussed in the next
section, can also result in incomplete or incorrect data entry. Similar issues can also occur with non-crash
data. For example, road asset data can be coded incorrectly, or data entry errors made during the analysis
of speed data.

DIFFERENCES IN VARIABLE DEFINITIONS
The definition of each variable (crash type, injury severity, location, etc.) can differ between data sources
(for example, police crash files, hospital records, insurance claims), jurisdictions and countries. This can
lead to complications in the identification of crashes of interest, the comparison of datasets, and the
evaluation of data quality within a dataset. Common confusing definitions are discussed below.

INJURY SEVERITY

The most common categories of injury severity are fatal, serious/severe and slight/minor injury. However,
the exact methods used by police and hospital staff to determine which injuries fit into which severity
categories can be problematic.

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 85/132



A recurring issue when comparing datasets from different countries is the timeframe that applies to ‘fatal’
injuries and crashes. The 30-day rule defines a fatal crash as when any person is killed immediately or dies
within 30 days as a result of a road crash injury, excluding suicides. The 30-day rule is the most common
classification used around the world, particularly by high- and middle income countries (WHO, 2010). Other
countries, particularly lower-income countries, use the definitions of ‘at the scene’ or ‘within 24 hours’ to
classify fatalities, which can create inconsistencies between databases. Adjustment factors have been
developed to account for this (WHO, 2010); however, this assumes that similar proportions of vulnerable
road users exist in each system, which is not necessarily the case (WHO, 2010).

The 30-day rule also implies that there is some coordination between the police officers who attended the
scene and hospital staff in order to check for updates on patient status after 30 days. This is often not the
case due to different priorities and workloads of those involved (WHO, 2010). The same issue arises with
regard to non-fatal injury classification: a serious/severe injury is often classified as ‘admission to hospital’;
however, police often classify this as all people who leave the scene in an ambulance (Langford, 2005).

Similarly, there is variation in what hospitals consider to be a ‘serious injury’ (see IRTAD (2011) for detailed
discussion of this issue). An increasing number of patients are being referred to specialist clinics (e.g.
fracture clinics) instead of being admitted to hospital. Therefore, in some databases it is difficult to tell
whether trends showing fewer admissions are a result of a change in the severity of crashes or a change in
the health care management system (Ward et al., 2006). IRTAD (2011) recommends that serious injury
should be determined by trained hospital staff and not the police at the scene of a crash. In reality, such
checks on crash severity outcome are often not made, and it is to the police in attendance to determine
the severity outcome.

In some countries ‘property damage only’ or ‘non-injury’ crashes are required to be reported, and in others
they are not. Sometimes the level of damage must exceed a certain monetary limit before it must be
reported. Such additional information can be of use, especially in the identification of crash locations and
likely causation, although it does entail a higher cost in terms of data collection and entry.

ROAD TRAFFIC CRASHED

The definition of a road traffic crash may incorporate or exclude crashes involving non-motorised vehicles.
It may also exclude crashes that occur on private roadways or in off-road locations such as parks and
parking lots. On the other hand, some countries collect information regardless of the location (WHO, 2010).

Another common issue is that hospital outpatient files often simply focus on the nature of the injury (e.g.
broken femur) and sometimes neglect to mention the external cause of the injury. This can make it
practically impossible to identify which cases are crash-related, and it also reduces the information
available to identify and treat crash locations (WHO, 2010).

LOCATION

There are a number of different methods used to determine the location of a crash (as discussed in Section
5.3 Establishing and Maintaining Crash Data Systems ). Each of these methods can be subject to error,
which can lead to inaccurate or non specific crash locations recorded by police. This can make it difficult to
assess the significance of particular crash locations.

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 86/132



UNDER-REPORTING
Under-reporting can occur at any point in the data collection and data entry processes. WHO (2010)
discusses the factors contributing to under-reporting in police data and health facility data in detail. Under-
reporting often varies with crash severity, transport mode, road user types involved, victim age, and the
crash location. Common findings are that (Langford, 2005; Ward et al., 2006):

Crashes only involving one vehicle are less likely to be reported than multi-vehicle crashes.
Reporting rates vary with hospital type (e.g. rural, private, etc.).
The higher the injury severity, the higher the reporting rates.
The older the victim, the higher the reporting rates.

This under-reporting issue can be a significant problem in all types of countries, but has been a particular
issue in LMICs (see Box 5.4 and Box 5.5).

BOX 5.4: UNDER-REPORTING OF CRASH DATA

The Global Status Report (WHO, 2023a) uses estimates based on a regression model for countries that
do not report death registrations to the WHO in a specified format. In many cases, the WHO estimates
differed considerably with the officially reported road deaths. A number of countries were estimated to
record only around 15–20% of deaths, while in one case the estimate was just 2.5%. Obviously more
needs to be done to improve reporting rates. The case study on RCVIS in Cambodia (see Establishing or
Improving Crash Databases ), reported in the 2013 edition of the Global Status Report (WHO, 2013),
highlights an approach that can be taken to improve reporting rates. This involved the collection of data
from two main sources, an approach that has significantly improved the situation in Cambodia. A similar
approach has been taken in Indonesia. In 2009, steps were taken to improve data collection, including
combining the police data with insurance and hospital data. As indicated in the figure below, reporting
of data improved substantially following this action.

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 87/132



FIGURE 5.5: NUMBER OF DEATHS PER YEAR IN INDONESIA (SOURCE: WHO, 2013)

However, as indicated by WHO (2013), this activity had the unintended outcome of indicating a
substantial increase in road crashes for 2010. This apparent increase is not a result of an actual
increase in road deaths, but rather an improvement in the recording of existing deaths. Several
countries are experiencing similar apparent increases in road deaths, when in reality the level of data
accuracy has improved. The improved data allows for better identification and management of road
safety issues. However, the impression that crashes are increasing substantially is an issue that also
needs to be managed.

Source: WHO, (2013).

BOX 5.5: DIFFERENCES BETWEEN POLICE DATA AND HOSPITAL DATA ON ROAD DEATHS IN MEXICO

In Mexico, the National Institute for Statistics and Geography (INEGI) generates the official statistics,
based on the collection of road crash information from local police and prosecution agencies and from
the Federal Police in the case of the crashes on Federal Highways. From this information source, deaths
at the site of the crash are registered. For 2012, this source yielded a figure of 10,008 deaths.
Furthermore, the Ministry of Health produces a database from the death certificates, registering the
causes of deaths due to road crashes. From this second source, all deaths caused by traffic crashes are
registered, yielding for 2012 a figure of 17,653. The difference between the figures from both sources
are deaths that do not occur at the site of the crash but sometime after the crash, i.e., by 2012 there

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 88/132



were 7,645 of these deaths. Furthermore, the figure of 17,653 deaths for 2012 underestimates the total
number of deaths due to road crashes, because for some of the deaths that occurred sometime after
the crash, in the death certificate a different cause than the road crash was recorded (e.g.
cardiopulmonary arrest, infection, brain death, organ failure).

It is typically the case that higher levels of severity have better levels of reporting. Many countries
(especially in HICs) record all fatal crashes and have reasonable records of more serious injury (e.g.
hospitalisation). Information for minor injury is typically less well reported. One quick way to determine the
likely scale of under-reporting rates for non-fatal crashes is to compare the ratios for fatal crashes to other
crash types between countries or regions. Although a number of factors need to be considered (e.g. road
types, vehicle fleet, average speeds, etc.), the discrepancy in these ratios can indicate differences in
reporting rates.

ASSESSING DATA QUALITY
Datasets can be assessed for under-reporting levels and data quality by comparison with other databases.
A common comparison to make is between police crash data and hospital in-patient data. Another source
is to use insurance claim data. Although these evaluations are very useful, it is not possible to determine
the real number of total road crashes as there is no way to know the exact intersection of the two
databases (Derriks & Mak, 2007). There will be some crashes that are recorded in police crash report
databases, but as victims are not always sent or admitted to hospital (i.e. in property damage only or
minor injury crashes), they do not always appear in the hospital database. Conversely, there will
undoubtedly be hospital injury records that are not crash related.

Matching hospital and police data allows cases to be checked for accuracy (ensuring the information
provided in both databases is the same) and also provides a basis to estimate the proportion of under-
reported cases in both the police and hospital files, as shown in the diagram below (Derriks & Mak, 2007).

FIGURE 5.6: MATCHING HOSPITAL AND POLICE DATA (SOURCE: DERRIKS & MAK, 2007)



©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 89/132



A common problem with this technique is that some countries do not allow the release of victim names
and sometimes even personal identification codes. Cases can then only be linked by other characteristics,
such as time, date and location (Langford, 2005). Data can only be reliably maintained when the data
quality is regularly monitored. WHO (2010) and IRTAD (2011) provide details on methods for assessing
data quality and under-reporting rates.

IMPROVING DATA QUALITY
It is typically not possible to successfully collect data for every crash on a network, but not all crashes
need to be reported to be able to draw conclusions and identify key priorities to improve road safety
(Langford, 2005; Vandervalk et al., 2017). However, the more comprehensive the data set, the higher the
reliability.

The main steps to improving data quality include:

A review of variable definitions, ensuring they are simple to understand and apply.
Reinforcing the need to report crashes, e.g. by making it a legal requirement.
Improving data collection tools (e.g. crash report documents and apparatus, coding
procedures).
Collecting accurate location information.
Improving training of police and data entry staff.
Ensuring the data collected is accurate and reliable through quality assurance measures.

Section 3.4.1 of WHO (2010) discusses in detail how the above steps can be put into action. It discusses
effective solutions such as the benefits of data entry systems with built-in checks to minimise mistakes
and engaging with police so that they see the value and importance of this task and their role within it. It is
also important to acknowledge that a balance must be found in the number of details the police must
record at a crash scene. Too many questions will lead to incomplete or missing crash reports, whereas too
few will limit essential details that are required for future analysis.

5.6 ANALYSIS AND USE OF DATA TO IMPROVE
SAFETY
Crash data can be extremely useful to a number of agencies and individuals, including:

Traffic engineers – in the identification, analysis and treatment of existing risks and the
prevention of future risk problems.
Policy-makers – at national, regional and local levels in setting crash reduction targets,
developing road safety action plans, and monitoring performance.
Police – in the identification of problem locations and times for enforcement.
Health sector – for resource planning, injury surveillance, health promotion and injury
prevention interventions.
Research community – in preventative studies and in testing and improving the effectiveness of
road safety treatments.
Insurance companies – in setting insurance rates and premiums.
Vehicle manufacturers – in the development of safer vehicles.
Prosecutors – in the use of data as evidence.

This section considers the availability of crash data, different users, and current international cooperative
efforts to improve crash data.

AVAILABILITY OF CRASH DATA
Crash data is useless to organisations that cannot access it. Appropriate methods for distributing data
should be developed for each agency that requires it, through the use of statistical reports, newsletters,
websites and workshops (WHO, 2010). If the funding is available, an excellent way to make crash data
available is through the use of online public searchable databases, which can provide customised reports
based on location, injury type, or other crash characteristics (WHO, 2010). An example of such a system is
provided in Box 5.6.

BOX 5.6: UK CRASH DATABASE ACCESS VIS THE INTERNET (CRASHMAP)

CrashMap (www.crashmap.co.uk) is a publicly available online tool that allows users to search for
crashes (by severity) to see where and when they took place. Users may nominate whether to include
all casualty types in the search results, or whether the results should focus on cyclist, pedestrian, child
or motorcycle casualties. The results provide a mapped display of crash locations, graphed with colour
tags to indicate the applicable severity level. Alternatively, tags may be uniquely coloured and display a
number greater than one, to indicate that multiple crash reports exist for a particular location. Each tag
provides an overview of the crash details, including the date of the crash, the severity level, and the
number of vehicles and casualties involved. Further details of crashes are available upon registration
with the site and at a small cost. This charge supports the ongoing maintenance of the service.

Another effective method to distribute data is through the media, which can act as an agent of change by

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 91/132



influencing public and political opinions.

It is important to remember that regardless of the method of distribution, those responsible for crash data
also hold the responsibility to protect the privacy of individuals involved. Steps can be taken to assist with
this as outlined in WHO (2010).

USES OF ROAD SAFETY DATA
ADVOCACY PURPOSES

Data can be used to raise awareness about particular road safety issues, and to act as evidence and draw
support for a certain policy, programme or allocation of resources (WHO, 2010). Common advocacy
activities include workshops, news reports and campaigns. Advocacy is an important part of road safety –
it can be the source of funding and public support. It is important to note that any advocacy material must
take the target audience and the context of the recommendation/cause into account in order to have a
desirable affect. WHO (2010) provides a number of tips for developing advocacy messages for policy-
makers. The Cambodia case study demonstrates the use of road safety data for advocacy purposes.

CASE STUDY - Cambodia: Summary Report from RCVIS

Although a developed database exists for the analysis of crash data, key information was not being
provided to appropriate stakeholders. Recognising that lengthy reports are not likely to be read by
senior managers and politicians, the National Road Safety Committee in Cambodia revised the
reporting from their crash system. Along with detailed reports, they produce a summary report that
provides key headline analysis on crash outcomes. Clear graphs, tables and maps are provided that
are easy to interpret, and can be quickly read and understood. This summary information is
particularly useful for advocacy purposes and for informing senior management of key issues. Read
More.

Road safety engineers are often the most common users of police-based crash databases for road safety
work. Crash data is used to identify high crash risk sites, as well as possible identification of risk factors
that are specific to the site. This is explained in further detail in Chapter 10. Assessing Potential Risks and
Identifying Issues .

In the identification of problematic crash locations, target groups or particular risk factors, policy makers
use crash data to approximate the size of the problem in terms of counts, severity, trends and the costs of
road traffic injuries (WHO, 2010). It is therefore important that these individuals have access to crash
characteristics, such as age group, crash type and road user group, so that they can make informed
decisions about which high-risk problems get priority and what solutions can be effectively implemented.

Police can also utilise crash data to target enforcement towards a particular issue or location. It is
important that the police receive regular feedback so that they can see how their efforts in the collection
of crash data, and in traffic enforcement, are having a positive impact (WHO, 2010).

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 92/132



MONONITORING, ANALYSING AND EVALUATING THE PERFORMANCE OF INITIATIVES

Crash data is essential to evaluate treatments and policies that have been introduced. Evaluations provide
a knowledge base about the effectiveness of a given treatment, as well as ensuring that current
programmes are providing the expected and desired results.

New analyses can strengthen the known effectiveness of an initiative, such as through the development of
crash modification factors (CMFs). Further information is provided in Chapter 12. Monitoring and Evaluation
of Road Safety on the monitoring, analysis and evaluation of road safety countermeasures, including the
effectiveness of treatments and development of CMFs.

INTERNATIONAL AND REGIONAL COLLABORATION

International cooperation is essential for data coordination and benchmarking. International assessments
can help to identify and monitor national road safety issues, as well as to evaluate the effectiveness of any
methods implemented on a wider scale. Benchmarking (through a comparison of safety performance with
similar peer countries, regions, cities, etc.) can lead to the identification of road safety issues that need to
be addressed. It is important to note that this cannot be achieved unless there is consistency across crash
variable definitions. Coordination also helps countries and governments to improve their road safety data
quality and collection systems (see Box 5.7).

BOX 5.7: INTERNATIONAL ROAD TRAFFIC AND ACCIDENT DATABASE (IRTAD)

FIGURE 5.7: IRTAD ROAD SAFETY ANNUAL REPORT (SOURCE: ITF, 2023)



In 1988, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) established the
International Road Traffic and Accident Database (IRTAD). This database includes crash and traffic data

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 93/132



from over 30 countries, which is continuously updated and analysed for trends.

The database includes data such as crash severity, road user group and road user age, and also
includes relevant country details such as population, vehicle composition, road network length and
seatbelt usage rates. This has allowed very useful benchmarking to occur, allowing comparison of
fatality rates (e.g. road fatalities per 100,000 population) between countries.

The IRTAD Group is a working group consisting of road safety experts and statisticians from all over the
world. Its main objective is to contribute to international cooperation on safety data and analysis. This is
achieved through the exchange of data collection and reporting systems and trends in road safety
policies, research and publications on key and emerging issues in road safety and through providing
advice on specific road safety issues to member countries.

The IRTAD Group is also in charge of the development of the IRTAD network and database coverage,
twinning programmes to assist LMICs in improving their data collection and reporting systems, the
IRTAD Conference, and publication of the Annual Report. It also provides standardised definition and
methodologies for comparison purposes (e.g. defining injury and crash severities)

Source: IRTAD

Within the framework of its outreach strategy in LMICs, IRTAD has launched a twinning programme to
assist countries. IRTAD is working with a number of organisations in an effort to assist LMICs improve their
data collection methods and database setup and management. Several such arrangements exist, including
twinning between Cambodia and the Netherlands, Jamaica and the UK, and Argentina and Spain. Other
partnerships are currently being developed. The first case study below provides information on the
twinning arrangements between Argentina and Spain. The second case study provides details of a broader
regional observatory in Latin America. Box 5.8 provides details of the IRTAD/OISEVI Buenos Aires
declaration on better safety data for better road safety outcomes.

CASE STUDY - Argentina and Spain: Twinning Arrangement

Lack of reliable and comprehensive information on accidents at a national level in Argentina. In April
2010, the World Bank provided funding for a twinning arrangement between Argentina and Spain, as
part of the IRTAD exchange. Spain assisted Argentina to improve its data collection and analysis
systems, with the view to help the ANSV, Agencia Nacional de Seguridad Vial (‘National Road Safety
Agency’, the lead agency in Argentina) become an IRTAD member. By developing a national crash
database, the data from all jurisdictions was collected using a standardised form to allow for the
inclusion of the ANSV Database in the IRTAD group. Read More.

CASE STUDY - Ibero-American: Road Safety Observatory

Lack of regional capacity in collection and analysis of road safety data. The OISEVI was created in

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 94/132



2011, and 18 countries have joined with the goal of sharing knowledge and best practice policy-
making and planning. The main aim of OISEVI is to share road safety information, particularly best
practices in policy formulation, planning, road safety strategies and data management. It is also
aimed at improving expertise in road safety and knowledge sharing among practitioners and
improving road safety outcomes in Ibero America. Read More.

BOX 5.8: BUENOS AIRES DECLARATION

In November 2013, 40 countries met at the Joint IRTAD/OISEVI Conference in Buenos Aires. The meeting
agreed on 12 recommendations on better safety data for better road safety outcomes, including that:

Reliable crash, contextual and exposure data are essential for understanding road safety
issues, setting targets and implementing effective policy.
A minimum set of data is required, including outcome data (including the number of persons
killed and injured by type of road users, type of roads, time, etc.), output level data
(including performance indicators) and contextual data (including exposure data such as
population, the number of vehicle kilometres driven).
Safety data should be aggregated at national level.
A road safety observatory, under a lead road safety agency or a lead ministry, is a good
institutional setting to raise the profile of road safety.
Regular monitoring and analysis of key road safety risk factors should be undertaken.
The international community should work towards harmonisation of data.
Information on injury crashes is essential for a more complete picture of road safety, and
MAIS3+ should be used to define a seriously injured road casualty.
Police data will remain the main source for road crash statistics, but this should be supported
by hospital data.
Benchmarking between countries is a useful way to generate road safety improvement and
learn from others.

Source: ITF

In Europe, a centralised database of road crashes has been developed. The Community Road Accident
Database (or CARE) is hosted by the European Commission and includes information on fatal and injury
crashes. Details on individual crashes are retained (i.e. the information is not combined), thereby allowing
for more powerful analyses to be conducted. A protocol for the collection of data has been developed, with
common variables specified. The intention of the database is to provide the basis for analysis to:

Identify and quantify safety problems on European roads.
Evaluate road safety measures.
Determine the impact of actions.
Share experience.

Further information on CARE can be found on the European Commission website.

5.7 INTEGRATING DATA
The integration of safety data provides a large number of benefits, including:

Effective management of safety (e.g. linking intermediate and final outcome data; see Section
5.2 Identifying Data Requirements).
Identifying crash risk types and locations in a more comprehensive manner (e.g. through
combined use of both reactive and proactive approaches, benchmarking, better information on
injury outcomes, greater knowledge of crash contributors; see Chapter 10. Assessing Potential
Risks & Identifying Issues).
Better knowledge in order to identify cost-effective solutions (e.g. through better knowledge of
the infrastructure that already exists; see Chapter 11. Intervention Selection and Prioritisation).

In addition, linked data can be used to validate other sources of information. As an example, crash
database systems can either draw information directly from asset data to provide additional information
on road elements, or this linkage can be used to reduce the likelihood that data entry errors will occur by
validating the presence of different road features or assets. It can also be used for research on specific
topics.

Key linkages include combining crash data with:

Traffic data.
Road inventory data.
Vehicle registrations.
Vehicle inspection data.
Population statistics.

The linkage process involves several stages and can be temporary (e.g. for a specific project or policy
need) or permanent (e.g. for ongoing analysis and monitoring). Data needs to be collected in a format to
facilitate linkage. This typically involves provision of a common data element, most usefully the spatial
coordinates for road based elements (including crashes), while for non-spatial data, another unique
identifier will be required for the datasets to be linked. A comprehensive safety information system may
have a large number of component files.

Once the data has been linked, it can be analysed through merging of data files. For spatial data, a GIS
software package is able to assist greatly in this task and is particularly useful for mapping information
from different sources.

Once the initial investment in collecting data has been made, it may be a relatively low-cost task to join
different sources of information together to meet a variety of needs, especially if a unique identifier has
been used in each dataset. In other circumstances, especially where data is not in a compatible format,
the task might be quite substantial involving considerable investment.

One of the more commonly used linkages is the calculation of crash rates to allow either benchmarking or
identification of high-risk locations. For example, crash data can be combined with population figures,
traffic volumes, or vehicle registrations to provide a useful comparison of risk. Ideally, each of these would
be presented as fatal and serious injury crash rates. Each of these measures is useful for different
purposes, as outlined below:

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 96/132



Crashes per 100,000 population: This measure reflects the direct impact of road crashes on a
country, region or community. It provides a useful basis to compare road safety outcomes with
other types of risk (e.g. risk of death from heart disease). It can also be used to identify risks for
different subsets of the community (e.g. risk by age, gender, location). This is one of the most
commonly used comparisons in road safety, particularly because it is easy to collect relevant
data to make this calculation.
Crashes per vehicle kilometres travelled (VKT): This measure reflects the level of safety based
on the amount of travel undertaken. It can be used to compare different travel modes (such as
between car, bus or train), different road types (e.g. undivided compared with divided roads) or
infrastructure (e.g. roundabouts compared with traffic signals). This requires good knowledge of
traffic volumes and distances travelled, and this information is often difficult to collect.
Crashes per 10,000 registered vehicles: This measure is often used as a proxy for the amount
of travel, as it is much easier to collect than kilometres travelled. It can be useful for analysis of
performance at a national level but has limited applicability for more detailed analysis.

Crash data can also be combined with road inventory data. At a simple level, this can provide information
about current road features that may be present, providing information about possible infrastructure
safety improvements. For example, crash data of run-off-road crashes could be presented alongside
information on current roadside barrier locations on a map to allow for a quick visual analysis of locations
that might benefit from further barrier installation.

Combining data on crashes with roadway, asset, environment, and traffic volume data can lead to some
important outcomes relating to safety performance of infrastructure. It is possible to compare the safety
performance of different types of infrastructure for different traffic volumes. For example, the performance
of divided and undivided roads can be compared for different traffic volumes. In addition, crash
performance of different infrastructure can be compared at different levels of traffic volume, for different
road user types, or for different environment types (e.g. low versus high-speed environments). Box 5.9
provides information on the US Highway Safety Information System.

BOX 5.9: US HIGHWAY SAFETY INFORMATION SYSTEM

The US Highway Safety Information System (HSIS) is managed under contract to the Federal Highway
Administration (FHWA). HSIS contains crash information (e.g. collision type, severity, vehicle
information, sex and age of occupants, objects struck, and weather conditions), inventory (e.g. road
type and function, cross-section, number of lanes, lane and median width, shoulder width and type),
and traffic volume data for several States. Information on curve/grade and intersection variables is also
available from some States. The combination of these different sources of data allows powerful analysis
to be conducted on specific road safety issues.

A large number of studies have been conducted using this rich source of information. This has led to the
production of various research reports, summaries and tools. Recent examples include a study that
examined the safety effects of horizontal curves and grades on rural two-lane highways; a safety
evaluation of lane and shoulder width combinations; an evaluation of the safety benefits of transverse
rumble strips on approaches to stop-controlled intersections in rural areas; and a review of the safety
benefits of ‘road diets’ (converting four lane arterial roads to two lanes, plus a central two-way turn
lane).

Recent initiatives in integration have involved the combination of crash data and road risk assessment
data. This provides a very powerful tool for identifying risk locations and possible solutions. Further
information on the combination of this data can be found in Section 10.5. Combining Crash Data and Road
Data and Chapter 11. Intervention Selection and Prioritisation.

The Denmark case study shows how data can be integrated to create a more accurate picture of
contributing factors to crashes.

CASE STUDY - Denmark: Danish Road Safety Accident Investigation Board

Road safety is in Denmark seen as a shared responsibility. The Danish Road Traffic Accident
Investigation Board (AIB) is one of the important players in the continued efforts to prevent road
accidents and minimize their implications. The AIB’s main purpose is to come up with new knowledge
and make recommendations for proposed actions to be implemented. The AIB consists of a multi-
disciplinary group that makes in-depth analyses of frequent and serious accident types to create a
more accurate picture of the factors contributing to accidents and recurring problems. Read more.

5.8 PATHWAY TO EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT AND
USE OF SAFETY DATA

GETTING STARTED
An assessment of data requirements should be made.
For countries with no comprehensive crash data, information on final and intermediate
outcomes should be collected for high-risk routes (e.g. high-volume roads) to allow
measurement of safety problems and identification of measures. This collection could be
undertaken as part of a corridor demonstration project.
A crash data system should be put in place. The steps required for this include the need
to: assess current data sources; engage with key stakeholders (the road agency, police
and the health sector are especially important); develop a crash report form; develop a
data system; and put in place a process to ensure data quality.
The focus should be on the collection of the range of data needed to address fatal and
serious injury crash outcomes which will include exposure data, final outcome data as well
as intermediate outcome data.
Road infrastructure/asset data collection should be considered to inform safety decisions,
for instance through a road assessment programme. This can provide information on likely
high risk crash locations as well as affordable treatments in the absence of comprehensive
crash data.

MAKING PROGRESS
A data collection strategy should be developed to ensure that essential information is
collected.
The crash data system should be routinely checked for accuracy and completeness (e.g.
by comparing police and hospital data).
The database should include basic features to allow comprehensive analysis of crash
problem types and be fit for use by the required stakeholders.
Information on road assets relating to safety outcomes should be collected.
Countries should be encouraged to aggregate data at national level, matching the IRTAD
structure and progressively contributing to the IRTAD database.
Other data relevant to the setting and monitoring of road safety targets and trends should
be collected, and the accuracy of this data assessed.
All outputs (such as reports) should be assessed to ensure that they are fit-for-purpose
and address the needs of key stakeholders.

CONSOLIDATING ACTIVITY
A comprehensive data collection strategy should be put in place and regularly monitored
to ensure that it is fit-for-purpose, accurate and complete.
A crash data base should be fully implemented that contains all crash data. Data should
be spatially coded, and appropriate quality control checks should be put in place.
Information on road assets relating to safety outcomes should be contained within a

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 99/132



comprehensive roadway inventory database. This may require the development of a
database, or linkage to an existing database.
Linkages should be made between key sources of data, particularly between data
collected by police and hospitals, and between crash and asset data.

6. ROAD SAFETY TARGETS, INVESTMENT
STRATEGIES, PLANS AND PROJECTS

KEY MESSAGES
Adoption of a Safe System goal for the long-term, supported by short- and medium-term
quantitative targets provides the focus for achieving better performance.
To achieve good performance, a strong linkage between road safety agencies and elected
members and Ministers in a country is essential.
Competent data collection and analysis of risk using the collected data is a precondition
for target-setting.
An assessment of a country’s road safety management system is appropriate to consider
the achieved results, the scope and quality of applied interventions, and the efficiency of
institutional management capacity.
Intervention selection should be guided by evidence of its likely effectiveness, assessment
of likely community and government support, and whether the country has the capacity to
implement it.
Implementation also requires identifying what changes to current operating practices
within agencies will be required, what impacts of actions on other policy areas will need to
be addressed, and the level of capacity needed to achieve successful implementation
progress.
Funding and implementation of a demonstration project to build capacity in LMICs is
strongly recommended as a first step. This will enable later-stage target setting,
strategy/action plan assembly and targeted outcome delivery to be achieved as successful
demonstration project approaches are then rolled out across the country.
The demonstration project should treat a high-risk corridor with a complete range of
interventions across the road safety agencies, review selected policies, establish project
management arrangements, and monitor outcomes to establish progress.
The demonstration project will develop capacities within agencies in LMICs (i.e. strong
bureaucratic and political linkages; improved advocacy; strengthened road safety
management, leadership, and coordination; and extended technical knowledge).
Strategies for the later growth and consolidation investment phases should be evidence-
based, and actions should be data-driven.
It is recommended that time-limited targets for these investment phases be ambitious,
but realistic. Substantial legislative actions will be an important vehicle to support policy
change as part of medium-term strategy.

6.1 INTRODUCTION
This chapter outlines the requirements for effective road safety performance and critical success factors
for road safety work.

After a thorough analysis of the country’s road safety management system and the analysis of the major
risk factors, it is advisable to develop action plans with defined targets at the country level and
performance measures. To determine the success of a program, or the implementation of an intervention,
a review of performance outcomes is needed. Because not all countries are at the same performance
levels, it is often advisable to start with demonstration or pilot projects. This is particularly true for LMIC,
who would benefit from the learning and building of road safety expertise through these types of projects.

Once a country recognises that it can no longer accept the level of death and serious injury occurring on
its road network, the common first response is to adopt a target performance level with a supporting road
safety strategy and plan (either a programme or a group of projects) to achieve that performance. The
approaches to target setting, investment strategy, and plan development of HICs are usually more
developed and build upon a more established road safety programme than is feasible for most LMICs at
the beginning of their road safety work. This is due primarily to the differences in road safety capacity
available to HICs in comparison to LMICs. Another reason is the absence of reliable crash data for LICs.

Investment strategies and plans with agreed targets need not only to be developed but also successfully
implemented. This is a substantial challenge.

It is useful to consider goals or targets being developed for three timeframes — there are long-term goals,
medium- and short-term targets. The setting of short and medium-term targets should always be
considered as milestones on the journey to achieving the ultimate target of eliminating death and serious
injury. Adoption of this long-term goal will shape actions planned and taken in the interim. The setting of
quantified targets for these timeframes is discussed in Section 6.4 Setting Targets. Within any timeframe,
targets can be set for final outcomes, (the usual measure), for intermediate outcomes and for institutional
outputs as defined in Chapter 3. The Road Safety Management System. These options are discussed
further in Section 6.7 Performance Indicators.

HOW DO I GET STARTED?
The underlying objective for LMICs will be the development of capacity to manage road safety,
through ‘learning by doing’. An important first step is the identification of weaknesses within the road
safety system (both for management and for risks on the network). This should be followed by the
adoption of a demonstration project – across the sectors – as an establishment investment phase to
build technical and management knowledge. Adequate government commitment and funding will be
critical.

This first step will enable informed later stage targets (for the medium and long-term timeframes)
and strategies/actions (for the associated growth and consolidation investment phases) to be devised
and implemented successfully, building – in the case of LMICs – on the roll-out across the country of
the interventions piloted in the demonstration corridor, the implementation of key policy reviews
carried out as part of the demonstration project, and the conduct of further reviews.

Funding and implementing a demonstration project (a multi-sectoral treatment of a corridor or urban
area, plus some key policy review activity) is the strongly recommended way to develop capability in
whole-of-government road safety management for LMICs. It should be the initial action taken,
following a road safety management capacity review.

For LMICs, a commitment to improving road safety outcomes may lead to an aspirational ‘top down’
target being adopted for the short-term (e.g. next five years) with recognition that delivery of that
initial target will be most challenging. However, the prime focus must be on a demonstration project
or projects.

6.2 STRENGTHENING CAPACITY TO SET AND
DELIVER TARGETS
REQUIREMENTS FOR EFFECTIVE ROAD SAFETY PERFORMANCE
To achieve good performance, a strong linkage between road safety agencies and elected members and
Ministers in a country is essential. Political commitment is required to lead a country’s efforts in addressing
road safety and to support institutional management functions.

BOX 6.1: GOOD PRACTICE COORDINATION AND DECISION-MAKING ARRANGEMENTS FOR ROAD SAFETY

A coordination framework that links road safety senior managers through executive management,
across relevant sectors, to a group of ministers meeting regularly – which makes operational decisions
at lower levels and formulates policy recommendations for, and reports on strategy performance to
ministers – reflects the necessary systematic view of road transport operation and its professional and
political challenges. Provision for public inquiry at parliamentary level and broad consultation
arrangements with stakeholders, including special interest groups, are recommended.

Success in road safety work will not come overnight. The need to develop management capacity and the
implementation of interventions needs time. Bliss and Breen (2013) indicate that achieving results will
require long-term political will that is translated into road safety investments that are targeted across a
range of sectors and in governance and institutions, infrastructure, vehicle fleets, licensing standards,
safety behaviours, and the health system. Adequate lead time for the development of organisational and
staff capability is needed.

CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS
Critical success factors (for HICs and LMICs) include:

Assessment of a Country’s Road Safety Problems – analysis of the current road crash situation
based on data as much as possible, identifying a country’s road safety issues.
Setting targets - setting meaningful numerical road safety targets, targets for selected road
users or risks, targets for individual agencies.
Development of action plans and investment plans – plans with timelines and accountabilities to
achieve them, including adequate funding and effective decision-making arrangements to
support intervention delivery.
Implementation of interventions.
Review of performance using a set of indicators.

strategic road safety action plan is described in the case study below. The Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) also highlights the need to build capacity.

CASE STUDY - Africa: Managing Road Safety: A framework for national lead agencies

Africa has the highest per capita rate of road fatalities in the world and is expected to worsen by the
year 2030. At a conference in Ghana in 2007, African Ministers responsible for Transport and Health
committed to transportation and health services improvements to prevent road crashes. In 2011, the
African Road Safety Action Plan 2011-2020 was adopted and endorsed by the African Union
Conference of Ministers. This Plan establishes a framework for African countries to develop a road
safety management system that guides them in becoming a national lead agency for improved road
safety and public health in Africa. The purpose of the framework is to increase national capacity to
address road safety problems. National commitment is required to spearhead a country’s efforts in
addressing road safety and champion institutional management functions. Read more.

CASE STUDY - Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN): Improving Road Safety

Rapid motorization in Asia and the Pacific, especially the explosive growth in motorcycle fleets, is
creating serious and growing road safety problems. The problem is particularly acute among Asian
developing countries, in which road crashes are now already the second most important cause of
premature death for the 5-14 years age group and the leading cause of death for the 15-44 years age
group. This effort builds on previous work by the ADB for ASEAN Countries, and focused on training,
pilot projects and working with private, non-governmental and other agencies to improve road safety.

6.3 ASSESSMENT OF A COUNTRY’S ROAD SAFETY
PROBLEMS
IDENTIFYING SPECIFIC NEEDS AND OPPORTUNITIES IN THE MANAGEMENT
SYSTEM
A regular assessment of a country’s road safety management system is appropriate to consider the
achieved results, the scope and quality of applied interventions, and the efficiency of institutional
management capacity. Results will reflect the interventions introduced and the effectiveness of those
interventions, as determined by the extent of critical supporting systems in place. This will include the
commitment to funding, the extent of relevant legislation, and the level of deterrence in place, including
enforcement and support from the justice system.

Key questions that need to be considered are:

How is road safety management influenced by the political model and the legal system within
the country, as well as historical and cultural practices?
Are the coordination, leadership, and decision-making arrangements across government
agencies adequate to achieve agreed problem definition, to develop a range of potential
interventions, to gain political support for these actions in a prioritised way, and to implement
them successfully?
Is sufficient data available, e.g. crash data to detect the major crash types, major serious crash
risks by type and location, and other data such as helmet wearing rates?
Is there supportive research and development available, working with the agencies to support
problem definition, targeting of issues, and evaluation of outcomes through evidence-based
intervention design?
Are measures in place to build provincial and local government capacity to improve road safety
outcomes?
How can knowledge and institutional management capacity be strengthened over time through
‘learning by doing’?

IDENTIFYING EXISTING NETWORK-LEVEL CRASH RISKS
Capacity to identify network-level crash risks is critically important. Countries face a variety of road safety
challenges on their networks. HICs have high light passenger vehicle motorisation rates, while LMICs
usually experience high two-wheeler motorisation rates, high roadside pedestrian volumes, and high
proportions of heavy vehicles (trucks and buses) in the vehicle fleet.

Issues influencing comparative crash risks on networks in different countries include:

TABLE 6.1: ISSUES INFLUENCING COMPARATIVE RISK

The levels of safe
infrastructure The mix of vehicle types The controls on drivers and

using the network vehicles entering and
provision remaining on the network

The levels of road user
The safety levels of compliance with the laws The emergency medical

the vehicle fleet and road rules (respect for management of crash
the rule of law) victims

Understanding the relationships between road safety performance and road safety conditions is a critical
requirement for assessing underlying crash risk on the road network and in taking action to reduce the
risks. Relevant aspects could be:

Abutting land use and roadside access control.
Road and roadside safety features.
Vehicle type, mix, and safety standards.
Travel speeds.
Driver and rider compliance with road laws.
Quality of road laws.
Novice driver licensing requirements.
And emergency medical management in a country.

An understanding of the scale of existing problems in a country requires availability of relevant data. A
lack of data makes it difficult to have a consistent, evidence-based approach to identify problems, and
implement specific countermeasures. Furthermore, good data systems are essential to measure the
outcomes of implemented interventions. The value of extensive and accurate data being available has
been demonstrated in Section 5.6 Analysis and Use of Data to Improve Safety.

Examples for the assessment of relationships between road safety performance and road safety
considerations are two European studies – SUNflower and SUNflower +6 – that provided insights into this
relationship in various European countries (see Box 6.3).

BOX 6.3: SUMMARY OF FINDINGS ON SAFETY CONDITIONS AND PERFORMANCE FROM THE SUNFLOWER +6
STUDY (2005)

The SUNflower study covered Sweden, UK and Netherlands. For these countries, relationships for safety

performance and underlying conditions were assessed, e.g.

Risks for pedestrians, motorcyclists, car occupants
Risk on motorways compared to other roads

The assessment led to factors that may have contributed to differences between road users or road
types and between the countries. Many of the report recommendations have been implemented in the
three countries, with positive results achieved.

The SUNflower+6 study additionally covered the Central European Countries Czech Republic, Hungary,
Slovenia, and the South-European Countries Greece, Portugal and Spain.

Development of road safety in the three Central European countries varied considerably. Results
reflected differences in national road safety management and enforcement strategies. In the South-
European countries, vertical coordination of safety activities from central and regional to the local level
was not well-developed. For some countries the identified changes were related to political changes
(e.g. Portugal, Hungary, and the Czech Republic). Generally, an increase in motorized traffic resulted in
a growing number of casualties. These growing numbers lead to increased attention on road safety,
leading to new road safety policies and organizational measures and safety measures in the countries
analysed.

Indications of the challenges faced in understanding network-level crash risks as illustrated in Figure 6.1.

HOWARD)



This is just one example demonstrating the inherently unsafe condition of infrastructural conditions. In this
case, the unrestricted access to the road from the roadside, and the overall poor level of management of
road safety on this section of the road network poses risks. It is a situation which occurs in many countries
across the world.

6.4 SETTING TARGETS
TARGET-SETTING APPROACHES
Target-setting can be based on the estimated outcomes of endorsed action plans. Alternatively (and most
commonly), targets can simply be aspirational. Establishing a road safety target is a major opportunity to
involve and inform the community about the road safety risks which exist in the community, the measures
available to reduce the risks, and to actively and openly seek the support for improved performance. There
are two main approaches to setting quantitative targets: top-down and bottom-up. Top-down target-setting
involves the establishment of idealistic objectives with limited consideration for their feasibility. Bottom-up
target-setting, conversely, focuses on achievable outcomes within a defined timeframe and resource
allocation. A combination of these approaches is also possible.

Top-down target-setting, such as applying the Decade of Action 50% fatality-reduction target for the period
from 2021-2030 (see Typical Numerical Targets Adopted below), is much more likely to be applied in
LMICs, as there is often little other evidence-based information on which to start their road safety journey.
However, this aspirational approach can often lead to disappointing short-term and medium-term results.

Bottom-up target setting is based upon a negotiated set of strategic actions with a calculated (estimated)
impact on fatalities and (serious) injuries. A prerequisite for this approach is good crash data, an
understanding of the safety issues, knowledge of potential solutions and adequate resources. More specific
targets can thus be developed. Before target-setting linkages between the administrative and the political
level are often useful for discussion and resolution of potential implementation issues (often beyond
transport impacts) that could otherwise block initiatives.

The bottom-up approach involves the following steps:

Analysis of the situation: develop an understanding of the extent of the road safety problem;
identify the main system deficiencies and their recent evolution.
Establishment of a list of priorities: consider all the components of the road safety system to
develop a balanced strategy.
Development of actions for each priority: assess the cost-effectiveness of each action. Priority
should be given to low-cost measures.
Determination of quantified sub-targets and main targets: make crash reduction sub-targets
ambitious but achievable, so that they serve to motivate.
Monitor to assess the effectiveness of countermeasures.
Feedback and corrective actions where necessary.

By following these steps and maintaining a strong focus on data-driven decision-making, bottom-up target
setting can significantly contribute to reducing road trauma.

Whether the top-down or bottom-up approach is used to produce a target, this knowledge and experience
will back strategy and action plan development and implementation. Either approach is capable of
supporting improved road safety performance. However, until sufficient capacity to manage road safety is
in place in a country, it is unlikely that a bottom-up approach will be feasible. For this reason, Table 6.2
indicates that for the ‘establishment’ and early ‘growth’ investment phases a top-down approach to target
setting is likely to be the only feasible option for LMICs.

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 112/132



 TABLE 6.2: FEASIBLE TARGET SETTING OPTIONS

Some issues are relevant for target setting in most cases:

Political support is essential; politicians need to be adequately supported to be prepared to
provide leadership in implementing beneficial road safety change.
Political commitment to regulation and legislation is important.
Adequate funding is necessary, with a long-term vision; economic costs of injury prevention
strategies can be set against government savings in terms of reduced levels of health and
welfare expenditure. This is a particularly important advocacy tool for use with finance
ministries, which in many countries play a decisive role in determining overall government
expenditure priorities.
Wherever possible ‘early wins’ should be identified and used to support the overall strategy;
this may involve setting targets or adopting measures that are less demanding in the early
phase of implementation, but which will result in encouragement to move further at a later
stage.
Dissemination of successes helps to gain confidence in the strategy and will build further
support within the government.

While LMICs could usefully base any short-term target they adopt on the five-to-ten-year targets currently
being adopted by good practice countries, there are major shortcomings in doing so:

In many LMICs, fatalities and serious injuries are continuing to increase as motorisation growth
continues.
LMICs usually do not have the building blocks in place in their investment establishment phase
to take the necessary action to achieve the change, which is being proposed in HICs, most of
which are in the growth, or even consolidation, phases.

Regional/, state and local plans and targets should reflect the adopted national approach, with variations
for local circumstances and intent. In this way, a more consistent understanding by the community, road
safety practitioners, and politicians at various levels of government can be established. However, target-
setting at the local level (as distinct from the regional or state level) is likely to be problematic as the data,
resources, and level of expertise are generally not readily available. Therefore, national or state targets
are often adopted, that is why national plans should provide sufficient flexibility for local preferences and
priorities to be identified and expressed in local plans.

CASE STUDIES – TARGET-SETTING
Contained below are a number of case studies on target setting:

CASE STUDY - Denmark: Road Safety Commission National Action Plan

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 113/132



The need to reduce fatal and injury crashes in Denmark, has led to the development of a national
action plan. Every crash is one too many - a shared responsibility is the official name for the Danish
Road Safety Commission National Action Plan 2013-2020. The number of road users killed or injured
on Danish roads has halved since 2001. A very important player is the Danish Road Safety
Commission who sets ambitious road safety targets on a regular basis. The targets are then used and
adopted by relevant stakeholders who making an effort and taking responsibility for implementing
the objectives to reach the target in the Action Plan. The stakeholders need to be supported by
political commitment and receive necessary earmarked funding for road safety to reach the target.

At each decision-making level, a road safety management system should be established and
operated. Such a system starts with the identification of hazardous road locations, followed by their
analysis, priority setting, the proposal and application of countermeasures, and the evaluation of
effectiveness. The national research project ‘IDEKO’ was undertaken by CDV – the Transport
Research Centre. Its objective was to develop methods and tools for the identification and treatment
of hazardous road locations. Read More.

CASE STUDY - England: Threestar roads by 2020

Highways England and the Department for Transport identified the need to reduce road fatalities and
serious injuries across their road network. In 2015, Highways England set a target to achieve 90% of
travel on 3-star or better roads across the strategic road network by 2020. In 2016, the Department
for Transport launched an innovative local roads fund that targets the highest risk 50 roads across
the country, as published by the Road Safety Foundation on an annual basis. Read more.

CASE STUDY - El Salvador: Coastal highway expansion project

The Coastal Highway Expansion Project in El Salvador sought to relieve congestion at the most-
trafficked segment of El Salvador’s coastal highway (CA-2). The CA-2 is one of the two most
important logistical corridors in the country and connects El Salvador’s major logistical nodes,
including its two seaports and the country’s only international airport. The Millennium Challenge
Corporation (MCC) is working in partnership with the Government of El Salvador to deliver the
US$101.6 million Coastal Highway Expansion Project. The work is part of MCC’s US$365.2 million El
Salvador Investment Compact with the Government of El Salvador. As part of the project, the MCC is
implementing road safety capacity building and Star Rating targets for the project, building on similar

success in the Philippines and Moldova. Read more.

A bottom-up approach to interim target-setting was followed in the state of Western Australia

CASE STUDY - Western Australia: A bottom-up approach to target setting

Western Australian asserts that viewing safety from a long-term vision to prevent death and serious
injury will result in fundamentally safe road designs. The state of Western Australia (WA), Australia,
developed a Safe System based road safety strategy for the period 2008 to 2020. A mathematical
model was developed to provide the projected benefits of implementation of a combination of best
practice Safe System countermeasures. Various options and combinations of benefits derived for a
range of policy and funding choices were provided to the public through a comprehensive public
consultation programme as the strategy was developed. Read more.

Top-down or aspirational target-setting is the most widely used method – and it is the only feasible
approach which can be used in the establishment phase. It can also be used effectively for the growth and
consolidation phases. For example, Sweden operates a mix of top-down and bottom-up approaches to
interim road safety target-setting.

CASE STUDY - Sweden: A mix of top down and bottom-up approaches

In 2012, Sweden conducted a review of its 2010 to 2020 strategy and its (then) current interim
targets and performance indicators to ensure that the interim targets for road safety remained
challenging and realistic. Reductions in fatalities in the three previous years (to 2012) had exceeded
earlier predicted outcomes and progress towards 2020 targets. Agencies meet six times a year to
monitor road safety performance against agreed objectives and targets to 2020, share knowledge
and coordinate efforts. The current goal for road safety specified an interim target for a 50%
reduction in fatalities and a 25% reduction in the number of serious injuries between 2007 and 2020.
Measures to improve road safety for children were to be given special priority. Read more.

TYPICAL NUMERICAL TARGETS ADOPTED – EXAMPLES
Road safety targets need to be quantitative and measurable so that the level of aspiration is clear, the
extent to which the target has been achieved can be determined, and if it has not been achieved, then the
extent to which the result is short of the target can be measured.

Quantified road safety targets have been set in a number of regions (see Chapter 2. Key Developments in
Road Safety) and countries in recent decades, including Finland, France, The Netherlands, Sweden, the
United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, and the United States.

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 115/132



Example Indonesia: targets and policy actions expressed in the National Road Safety Master Plan 2011-
2035 (Republic of Indonesia) are:

50% reduction of fatalities per population by 2020.
80% reduction in the fatality rate per population by 2035.

Example Ireland: Ireland has achieved substantial fatality reductions in recent years to be among the best
performing EU countries. The strategy adopted for the period 2013 to 2020 has the following targets (Road
Safety Authority, 2013):

24% reduction in fatalities.
40% reduction in serious injuries over the life of the strategy.

SETTING TARGETS FOR SELECTED ROAD USER GROUPS/RISKS
In addition to final outcome targets for overall fatalities and serious injuries being defined in a strategy,
outcome targets can be set for different at-risk road user groups and for various risk categories under the
Safe System pillars.

For example, the New Zealand Safer Journeys 2010-2020 Strategy (Ministry of Transport, 2010) targeted a
40% reduction in the fatality rate of young people and a 20% reduction in fatalities resulting from crashes
involving drug or alcohol impaired drivers, as shown in Table 6.3.

TARGET-SETTING FOR INDIVIDUAL AGENCIES
Final outcome, intermediate outcome or output targets can also be devised at an organisational (road
safety agency) level, compared to an overall target for final outcomes across the country – which are to be
achieved as a result of contributions from all agencies.

It is most useful for all organisations to have their own strategic plan, actions, and targets, based on the
jurisdiction’s overall strategy. The agency’s strategy should indicate, in as measurable a manner as
possible, how and what they intend to achieve with their own activities to meet their obligations as part of
the overall country target.

6.5 ACTION AND INVESTMENT PLANS
STRATEGIES AND ACTIONS
Both strategies and actions are investment plans. However, Beer et al. (2013) note that there is a
considerable difference between countries regarding what is included in a strategy document and what is
included in action plans. It notes that one key point of difference is the level of detail on specific measures.
Some include greater detail within the strategy, some leave detail to the action plans, while others provide
detail for the initial period of the strategy, (e.g. the first two years) but rely on action plans (reviewed
perhaps every two years) to supply detail for later stages of the strategy. It concludes that there is no
answer as to which is the best approach on this issue. The important point is that the strategy should allow
enough flexibility to address any specific problems that arise as the strategy unfolds (for instance, in light
of new information on potential problem groups), shifts in the political environment (including changes in
funding or priorities), or with the emergence of new techniques to address risk. The action plan, on the
other hand, should provide detailed descriptions of what will be accomplished for each action, along with a
timetable, costs and expected benefits, while having the following characteristics:

Actions should be realistic (taking account of financial and other types of constraints).
Actions should be selected in all key areas of road safety (balanced program).
Priority should be given to measures which have been shown to be cost-effective.

TARGET-SETTING TIMEFRAMES
Investment strategies and actions need to be adopted to support improved road safety performance and
the achievement of targets – in the short-term (one to three years), the medium-term (three to ten years)
as well as in the long-term (beyond ten years). For LMICs, steady progress through demonstration projects
is the recommended option for the short-term, with or without an aspirational (notional) short-term target.

For both LMICs and HICs, thoughtful investment plans and strategies will be essential to achieve steady
progress towards medium-term targets and eventually to move further towards the ultimate long-term
goal (see the Chapter 3. Road Safety Management System). An understanding of the relationship between
investment phases and strategy timeframes is necessary.

FIGURE 6.2: THE PHASES OF INVESTMENT STRATEGY
SOURCE: ADAPTED FROM MULDER AND WEGMAN,1999



The establishment (short-term timeframe) phase of road safety investment planning focuses on building
core capacity to enable effective targeted road safety performance to begin and grow. The two key
purposes of activity in this phase should be:

Setting up management and coordination arrangements for road safety.
Developing a performance management culture.

Tasks to be accomplished in this phase may include the development and implementation of necessary
data systems, tools and guidelines and strengthened legislation to be in place in time to support later
implementation phases.

In the growth (medium-term timeframe) investment phase, key priorities are:

Developing a robust performance management framework for all agencies with targeted safety
programmes.
Implementation of recommended changes from policy reviews undertaken in the establishment
phase.
Adequate funding.

In the consolidation (long-term) investment phase, key priorities are:

Ensuring the performance management framework has been established in regions and
districts.
Improvement of management and operational efficiency and effectiveness.
Seeking opportunities for future safety innovations.

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 119/132



PRINCIPLES OF ACTION PLANS AND INVESTMENT PLANS
As stated above, action plans and investment plans can deal with different timeframes (short-term,
medium-term, and long-term). However, a clear definition of some aspects is essential, as they are
important for the success of the plans in any timescale:

Targets should be linked with defined timelines in which they should be achieved.
Adequate funding has to be ensured.
Accountabilities have to be defined.
An effective decision making should be applied and consultation arrangements to support the
implementation of measures.

The challenge in LMICs is to achieve the preconditions necessary to deliver the planned outcomes. This
usually requires years of sustained effort. Road safety improvement is a continuous process requiring
ongoing commitment.

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 120/132



6.6 IMPLEMENTATION OF INTERVENTIONS
ACHIEVING RESULTS IN THE ESTABLISHMENT PHASES
For all countries, in the initial establishment phase, there are known interventions, which if implemented
effectively, will deliver results (see Chapter 11. Intervention Selection and Prioritisation). These
interventions include:

Safer speed.
Improved safety of road and roadside infrastructure.
Increasing seatbelt wearing rate.
Improving safety for vulnerable road users (pedestrians, two-wheeler riders, cyclists).
Reduced drink driving.
Improved post-crash medical care.

These recommended measures are applicable to all countries. However, there are further measures which
would be relevant in targeting improved safety in Low and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs). These
measures include:

Safer heavy vehicles (trucks and buses).
Safer heavy vehicle driver compliance with road rules.
And further measures for two-wheelers, especially motorcyclists should focus on helmet
wearing and, at a minimum, the provision of hard shoulder on rural roads.

In addition to these interventions, supporting tasks may be necessary to enhance road safety
performance, especially in LMICs. For these countries, demonstration projects and other methods,
including ongoing strengthening of existing road safety activities and the development of digital data
systems for licensing and offence records (and their linkage) will be a challenging, but rewarding process.
Improvements to public sector governance and the implementation of the supportive, enabling systems
necessary to underpin good public policy and good road safety performance, will take considerable
focused effort over a number of years.

These are considerable challenges. This is not to discourage immediate action, but there needs to be a
realistic sense of what can be achieved in the short-term. Success will depend heavily on:

The level of resources available.
The advisory expertise marshalled in support (particularly for overall project management and
administrations).
The outcome focus of the activity.
The extent of high-level commitment to achieving change and performance improvement.

It is also vital that actions which inadvertently increase road crash risks are avoided even if the outcome is
unintended. Box 6.4 details the unexpected impact of resurfacing of roads leading to higher travel speeds
and therefore increased fatalities in former East Germany before remedial measures were implemented.

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 121/132



BOX 6.4: STATE OF BRANDENBURG, GERMANY, EARLY 1990S

The experience of the German State of Brandenburg in the years immediately after German
reunification provides insight for other emerging countries. Initially there was:

Little road safety experience within the road authorities.
A high proportion of aged/unsafe vehicles on the network.
Many novice drivers with little pre-licence supervised driving experience.
Police reluctance to actively enforce road rules due to historical links to the former political
system.

An early action reflected the lack of available knowledge. A programme of new asphalt resurfacing of
existing roads without corresponding safety mitigation measures resulted in increased speeds and
greater numbers of fatalities. Time was required to identify appropriate road safety actions. Within a
few years road safety success was eventually achieved, with a reduction of 72% in severe crashes and
81% reduction in fatalities sustainably over 20 years.

ACHIEVING RESULTS IN THE GROWTH AND CONSOLIDATION PHASES
For the growth and consolidation phases of investment, development of comprehensive strategies and
action plans will be necessary and there will be capacity available by then to build meaningful proposals
which can be fully assessed for their likely contribution to proposed targets. In the later part of the growth
phase and beyond, the estimated aggregate impact of implementable actions could be used to set a target
(see Section 6.4 Setting Targets).

In this phase developed capacity data, tools and knowledge have to be available to:

Enable a more detailed analysis of risks on a regular basis.
Analyse crash outcome risks.
Review existing action plans.
Develop countermeasure strategies and actions.
Evaluate implemented measures and economic measures (e.g. benefit-cost ratio, net present
value and first year rate of return).
Guide initiatives through legislative and policy development processes.
Disseminate results (e.g. by work, knowledge exchange, and information campaigns)

In both HICs and LMICs there will be many potential interventions which can be applied in the growth
phase and beyond. Later chapters address road safety engineering interventions in detail (see Chapter 11.
Intervention Selection and Prioritisation), and other interventions (such as improved road user behaviour
through legislation, enforcement, and licensing; improved vehicle standards; and improved post-crash
care) are also important.

Interventions (i.e. countermeasures) to address the identified risks in the growth and consolidation
investment phases can be developed based on evidence from demonstration projects and other

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 122/132



jurisdictions, as well as from research. The Austroads Guide to Road Safety Part 7 (Beer et al., 2021)
provides a conceptual framework for countermeasure selection, based on the Safe System approach, and
sets out steps for:

Aligning countermeasures to problems.
Assessing whether particular countermeasures are likely to be successful.
The likely returns on investment.
The capacity to deliver particular countermeasures.

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 123/132



6.7 PERFORMANCE INDICATORS
After setting targets, developing action and investment plans and the implementation of interventions it is
of utmost importance to review the performance. Intermediate outcomes (performance indicators) (ITF,
2008) are valuable in predicting final outcomes (see also Chapter 5. The Road Safety Management System
and Effective Management and Use of Safety Data).

Safety Performance Indicators can be used to measure progress in implementing the Safe System. They
can also help to implement process-oriented road safety interventions corresponding to a wider range of
public policy instruments (Vedung, 2017).

A number of possible intermediate outcome measures are specified in those chapters, for example,
seatbelt wearing rates or speed monitoring. For LMICs e.g. truck rear lighting operational rates, wrong-way
vehicle travel rates, proportion of length of high pedestrian areas with footpaths, rate of provision of raised
speed reduction devices with high-visibility advanced signage at pedestrian crossings on arterial roads in
urban areas, and more can be mentioned.

One option (Beer et al., 2021) to link these measures to adopted targets, is to develop an ‘outcome
management’ framework which directly links the outputs from the strategy (i.e. what will be done) with
outcomes (i.e. what is to be achieved). This is a useful approach which focuses attention on key outcomes,
encourages modelling of effectiveness of outputs on final and intermediate outcomes achieved, and
assists in the monitoring process.

6.8 DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS
STRENGTHENING CAPACITY THROUGH DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS
Establishing road safety targets and investment strategies and plans is complex, requiring:

knowledge of existing road safety risks,
awareness of what can be done, and
having the capacity to effectively manage the change processes necessary within agencies to
achieve integration of road safety activities.

As recommended in Section 3.2 Management System Framework and Tools, the first step for LMICs in
establishing their road safety activity (their establishment investment phase) will be to prepare
demonstration projects rather than embark on ambitious national road safety plans and aspirational
targets which are more appropriate for the growth investment phase in the medium-term. Box 6.5 outlines
the high-level objectives of Safe System demonstration projects.

BOX 6.5: WORLD BANK SAFE SYSTEM DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS: HIGH-LEVEL OBJECTIVES

The generic high-level objectives of demonstration project programmes are to:

Target road safety results in selected high-risk, high-volume roads/areas for the long-term
and the interim.
Provide dimensions for new quantitative target-setting, business cases, and roll-out.
Provide opportunity, focus and mechanisms for policy development and policy pilots.
Aid institutional strengthening, especially lead agency delivery, coordination and multi-
sectoral partnership working, monitoring and evaluation, and knowledge transfer.
Enhance political, professional and public acceptability of important interventions.

Source: Bliss & Breen, 2013

It is important to note that a demonstration project must be carefully adapted to each country. Even
though the project will generate expertise, it is vital to prepare an ongoing programme for future actions,
based on each country’s capacity.

For HICs, demonstration projects across road safety agencies that trial innovative treatments can also be
an effective way to prepare for wider rollouts. They strengthen institutional leadership and capacity,
including knowledge and delivery partnerships. Projects of this nature provide a focused opportunity; for
example, the chance to trial and embed Safe System approaches within new strategies and practices of
the road safety agencies.

DEMONSTRATION PROJECT FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT PHASE IN LMICS
Road Safety demonstration projects could be multi-sectoral activities on selected road corridors or in
specific urban areas, and they could also include selected jurisdiction-wide road safety policy reviews. All

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 125/132



require coordinated action, by and across the road safety agencies, but with projects at a smaller and
more manageable scale than for the complete country or for all potential policy reviews. Note that the
term ‘demonstration project’ is sometimes used to describe a small-scale trial of a specific treatment type
(e.g. a new innovative treatment). Advice on these and other lower cost approaches is provided elsewhere
in this manual (see from Chapter 9. Infrastructure Safety Management: Policies, Standards, Guidelines and
Tools).

Capacity needs to be progressively developed, with coordination and decision-making mechanisms agreed
upon by the road safety agencies, and then successfully introduced and experienced on a day-to-day
basis. Links to decision-making at the political level (between Ministers) need to be achieved. In this
environment of unavoidably slower development of understanding and capacity, most benefit will be
derived by ‘learning by doing’. The key deliverable would be improved capacity of the country’s road
safety agencies to deliver road safety improvement. It would also provide a clear message to the
community that improved performance is achievable.

Coordinated on-road corridor treatments of demonstration projects can be:

The enforcement of laws.
The identification and treatment of blackspots or high crash risk sections.
Improving the emergency medical management systems for post-crash care.
Public information programmes to raise awareness of what is being done and the benefits it will
bring.

Separate from those corridor actions, policy development components of demonstration projects (separate
from the corridor actions) will usually include some of the following:

New driver licensing procedures and policies, including testing.
Improved vehicle safety policies.
Strengthened road safety rules and regulations.
Improved licence, and vehicle and traffic offence data systems and their linkage.

The resourcing, guidance and persistence needed to achieve even small changes in approach by the
agencies will be substantial. Experience has shown that the level of effort required for this is consistently
underestimated and under-resourced. The measurement (both baseline and ongoing) and monitoring of
intermediate outcome performance is an essential component of demonstration project activity and is
important for the later phases of broader road safety activity.

While detailed digital crash record databases may not be available, the level of overall fatalities can be
collated from local police records and hospital records for the demonstration project corridor activity, and
usually (with effort) for a larger area. The country would then be in a position to assemble the evidence
base to assess demonstration project benefits, and this would support a broad roll-out programme for the
subsequent medium term or growth phase.

Detailed project objectives and project components for a road safety demonstration project, drawn from
recommendations for the establishment phase arising from a typical recent World Bank road safety
management capacity review, are set out in Tables 6.4 and 6.5.

TABLE 6.4: DETAILED OBJECTIVES FOR A SPECIFIC DEMONSTRATION PROJECT

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 126/132



Strengthen road safety management capacity in Country A to deliver a
1 demonstration project. Establish road safety decision-making arrangements

at executive and working group levels of the key agencies, and consultation
arrangements with stakeholder groups/ and experts.

Designate a lead agency to conduct the demonstration project and specify
2 its formal objectives, functions and resourcing requirements. This will

include a small road safety cell to provide advice and secretariat services to
the coordinated decision-making of project partners.

3 Develop and implement interventions by the sectors in a selected corridor.
Monitor and measure changes in road safety performance.

4 Identify and conduct selected policy reviews to address key road safety
priorities. Make recommendations to improve road safety results.

5 Accelerate road safety knowledge transfer to strategic partners.

These five objectives are interrelated and mutually reinforcing. The aim is to create a joint project which
encourages agencies to work together constructively to deliver (and then evaluate) a set of well-targeted,
good practice interventions across the sectors in identified higher-risk corridors; conduct further policy
reviews; and accelerate road safety knowledge transfer. It is anticipated that the road safety
demonstration project may typically cost around US $20 million (and at least $10 million as a minimum),
have four major components and be implemented over a four-year timeframe (see Table 6.5).

The recommended scale of demonstration projects is around this amount and timescale, because minor
funding is unlikely to realise the benefits described earlier in this section. The substantial change in the
management of road safety from individual agency ‘best efforts’ to a coordinated and well led whole-of-
government management approach, which builds the skills necessary to manage a country-wide
improvement, requires significant investment and leadership. Governments and funding agencies need to
recognise this requirement. An example of a demonstration project is provided in the Kerala, India, case
study.

safety performance upgrade through multi-sectoral efforts is an 80-kilometre length of MC Road, a
State Highway, from Kazhakkoottam to Adoor. This major highway passes through some rural areas,
but there are many towns and much urban (ribbon) development along its length. The three-year
project has a budget of some US $14 million and is funded by the Government of Kerala and the
World Bank. Read more.

6.9 PATHWAY TO IMPLEMENTING ROAD SAFETY
TARGETS, INVESTMENT STRATEGIES, PLANS AND
PROJECTS

GETTING STARTED
LMICs should commission an expert road safety management capacity review, adopt the
Safe System goal and approach, identify their road safety risks and then develop, fund
and prepare a demonstration project involving all agencies. It should include a multi-
sectoral treatment for a substantial higher-risk corridor or urban area plus selected
national policy reviews. This should form the LMIC investment plan for the establishment
phase.
The planned demonstration project should address a high-risk corridor or extensive urban
area with a complete range of interventions across the road safety agencies, identify
selected policy areas for review (for example driver licence testing requirements, vehicle
safety standards), establish project management arrangements and prepare for
monitoring and measuring of agreed intermediate outcome safety measures (such as
mean speeds, seatbelt and helmet wearing rates and alcohol impairment rates in fatal and
serious crashes on the corridor) to ensure progress being achieved with the demonstration
project to be identified on an ongoing basis.
Project management for the demonstration project is to include identification of an agreed
lead agency to support coordination and decision-making activities within a newly
established project working group of agencies. The working group will report to a senior
level steering committee of agencies.
Implement a crash data system as a priority.

MAKING PROGRESS
Complete implementation of the demonstration project.
Progressively evaluate performance by measuring and reporting intermediate outcomes
and final outcomes to the public.
Enhance knowledge and capability through various methods, such as exchanges,
information sharing with other jurisdictions, fact-finding missions, and international
literature reviews, to implement effective interventions.
Develop legislation and systems and promote senior government executive and public
awareness of the need for their commitment to road safety investment.
Achieve adequate funding to progressively extend the demonstration project outcomes
(suitably modified based on lessons learned) across the network.
Implement ongoing reforms of safety policies and institutional management
arrangements, including adoption of a national lead agency, its agreed role and
responsibilities, and agency coordination and support.

CONSOLIDATING ACTIVITY
Disseminate crash data and other safety performance data from the national crash

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 130/132



analysis system.
Set medium-term targets for country outcomes, country intermediate outcomes and
outputs by organisations and develop and implement growth investment (strategy and
action) plans to achieve these targets. HICs are likely to be carrying out these tasks as an
immediate priority.
Determine whether top-down or bottom-up target setting is to be used, and review the
targets being adopted by leading countries for guidance.
Implement comprehensive multi-sectoral measures across the total network.
Manage, monitor, and report on road safety performance across the network.
In the longer-term consolidation investment phase, support regions and local governments
to develop longer-term targets, strategies/action plans and safety performance
monitoring.

7. ROLES, RESPONSIBILITIES, POLICY
DEVELOPMENT AND PROGRAMMES

KEY MESSAGES
The government through the road authority has responsibility for the provision of safe
infrastructure and safe operation of the road network. In some countries, the road
authority also carries out the lead agency function.
Legislated safety-related roles and responsibilities should be clearly set and state the Safe
System principles the authority seeks to operate under, as well as its strategic objective
for implementing a Safe System approach.
Implementation of a Safe System approach requires a fundamental change in the way the
authority addresses safety risk on the network. To support this change management
challenge there will be a requirement for structured training.
Embedded in the Safe System approach are processes, procedures, policies, guidelines
and tools that are applied to new works, maintenance, operations and retrofitting of the
existing network.
Formalise how the Safe System objectives are considered during project development for
safety, traffic management and asset management purposes, as well as operational and
cost efficiency.
Formalise the manner in which a road authority applies its policies to its operations, to
include measures of performance against those policies and expected outcomes. (e.g. a
network safety management system).
Acquire or refine legislative powers that provide road authorities, in consultation with the
local authority and community, the ability to impose restrictions on access to/from new or
existing developments, where these are deemed to be unsafe.

7.1 INTRODUCTION
Responsibilities of a road authority include safe road design for new roads, safety improvements of
existing roads, safer outcomes from road maintenance and network operation activities. Actions need to
be undertaken within the whole-of-government road safety efforts. These activities need to be conducted
within a Safe System framework, a transforming safety agenda that will influence all the activities of a
road authority, not just those activities traditionally considered to be the functions of a road authority’s
safety division. It challenges road authorities to rethink their activities. This is a major challenge for every
road authority – how to integrate Safe System principles and elements into all its activities.

ROAD SAFETY AUTHORITY:

Case 1. In some jurisdictions, the road authority will be the lead road safety agency, particularly where the
authority is also responsible for traffic management, driver licensing and vehicle registration.

Case 2. However, in many instances, the road authority will have reduced responsibilities and will not be
the lead agency.

What can we do in such case? In this situation it will need to rely more heavily on the cooperation of other
stakeholders to achieve the desired safety outcomes. In all cases, road authorities need to have a strong
external focus to achieve gains in other Safe System elements that are outside their normal areas of
operation.

Key stakeholders include:

National road operators.
Regional/local roads operators.
Toll motorways operators.
All the law enforcement and emergency agencies (road Police, national security, army, fire
corps, heath care personnel, etc).
Safety experts from government and industry, including vehicle, installations, new technologies
and infrastructures specialists.
Bureau of standards and regulatory bodies.
Driving schools, licensing authorities.
The public.

This cooperative role requires strengthened knowledge and new skills in outreach and communication
because it is necessary to work with others outside of one’s typical profession.

The focus in this chapter is on embedding the Safe System approach within the responsibilities, (planning,
policies, programmes and operational activities) of the road authority in a jurisdiction, particularly the
identification of necessary changes, their progressive introduction and their ongoing application. It is
important to recognise change is necessary to achieve the Safe System approach and it is important to
consider the steps necessary to achieve this overall goal. It is also important to recognise that the level of
effort may vary depending on the will of the decision makers responsible for providing resources to the
effort.

HOW DO I GET STARTED?
STEP 1: gathering and collecting information on the existing system

The starting point should be mapping the alignment of existing functions and responsibilities of the
road and other safety authorities participating in the effort to implement the Safe System principles.
This will produce an understanding of the extent of alteration required to align the activities of all
authorities. This adjustment will have to be substantial and will need to take place progressively as
understanding and experience with application of principles increases.

STEP 2: consultation and discussion

Effective change management strategies are supported by corporate-wide processes for input,
consultation and discussion. A strategic framework with clear objectives needs to be put in place and
progressively strengthened with policies and guidelines as knowledge increases. All changes will
need to include a continuous improvement and feedback process to refine and identify necessary
adjustment to current approaches and priorities in all areas of the authority’s activity.

STEP 3: institutionalization and formalization

The new approach will need to be fully embedded in the road network management approach of the
road authority and formalisation of this positioning is recommended in time. Regular assessment of
the coverage and effectiveness of this ‘embedding’ activity will be needed.

FUNDING POINTS:

1. Clarity and relevance of new policies and the success of the early program delivery.
2. National road authority’s support for provincial and local governments for their development of

consistent and improved road agency practice.

7.2 UNDERSTANDING A ROAD AUTHORITY’S
ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES
RESPONSIBILITIES WILL REFLECT APPLICABLE LEGISLATION
Relevant legislation and regulations will prescribe the functions and responsibilities of a road authority in a
country. While the nature and extent of these responsibilities varies from country to country, it will usually
encompass planning and construction for major new road projects, safety, asset management, traffic
management, road maintenance, and of way and abutting development regulation, to varying degrees.

The responsibility for the setting of speed limits on all roads, or perhaps just for national or state roads,
while issuing guidance for speed limits and design standards on local roads is likely to rest with national or
state road authorities. However, this is less likely to be the situation in a number of LMICs.

As a basic starting point, the legal obligations of a road authority for safe operation of its network will
require risk management systems and procedures to be in place that:

Acknowledge road safety as a key objective in road network management.
Provide for adequate regular safety inspection of the road network.
Specify steps to be taken when unsafe conditions are detected.

As an example, road authorities may have a duty of care to identify, assess and prioritise risks, and take
reasonable measures to address them. This obligation typically covers all road users (including
pedestrians, bicyclist, and emerging mobility devices), and covers the full road reserve (i.e. including roads
and roadsides).

However, countries will have varying legislative and regulatory responsibilities setting out safety
requirements that are binding upon their road authorities.

IMPACT OF SEPARATION OF RESPONSIBITIES ON ROAD SAFETY
PERFORMANCE
A priority safety focus for road authorities should include infrastructure safety, land use and access control
from land abutting road reservations and speed limit setting. The Safe System approach requires all the
elements affecting safety on the network to be taken into account by the road authority when discharging
its responsibilities.

This can become complicated in situations where responsibilities are divided or separated among different
departments. For example, the setting of speed limits, traffic management planning and the management
of heavy vehicle operations may be handled by departments other than the road authority (e.g.
Department of Transport or Police). In these instances, there is the challenge of reaching agreement with
other departments about consistent practices.

It is recommended, wherever possible, that these responsibilities be made part of a road authority’s role. If
this cannot be achieved, the road authority must be empowered to be involved (with their agreement) in
establishing guidelines and standards which will be applied to these responsibilities.

All of these matters are associated with safe operation and use of the network. These operational
characteristics are a key determinant of the level of crash risk experienced on the network. Considerably
more active coordination effort than usual will be necessary for the agencies to achieve effective safety
outcomes in these ‘separated responsibility’ situations.

SUPPORT NEEDED FROM OTHER AUTHORITIES FOR SATISFACTORY ROAD
USER COMPLIANCE
The road authority has an obligation to support achievement of:

The level of road user behaviour that was assumed in the design for new road works.
The level of behaviour required to achieve safe operation of the existing network.

Road authorities need to work with local police and provincial and local governments to explain the
importance of their roles in achieving safe operation of the road network. They need to support and
encourage police action in achieving compliance with speed limits, but also for seatbelt and helmet
wearing, pedestrian priority on crossings, safe overtaking, observing traffic controls at intersections, safe
heavy vehicle operation and minimising impaired driving.

FACILITATING MAINSTREAM APPROACHES
The Road Safety Policies Team: Within a road authority exists a group of professionals with accountability
for initiating road safety policy and guideline development (usually a road safety engineering team or
section) and for making relevant recommendations to the senior corporate group which carries a
considerable responsibility. Such a Group needs to be prepared to put forward policy positions that would
reduce crash risk on the network, while recognising that this will impact upon traditional approaches.

The Road Safety Engineering Team: Other parts of the organisation (maintenance, design, asset

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 9/353



management, traffic management) will need to be consulted and engaged in order to assist the change in
thinking necessary for gaining corporate support for changing their activities. This is a substantial task –
shifting the traditional approach taken to building and maintenance of roads – in order to win the
understanding and acceptance of the need for retrofitting work on road networks to change crash risk
profiles over time. A road safety engineering team within a road authority should be capable of operating
as a centre of expertise to support the roll-out of road safety knowledge and programmes across the
regions and, as appropriate, within head office functions.

Expertise will be needed to carry out a number of key functions including:

Provision of strategic advice to the corporate management group for improvement of road
safety outcomes and delivery of allocated national road safety strategy actions.
Support for the regions, including training courses, to progressively increase understanding and
application of the Safe System approach and related tools.
Guiding revision and development of standards, guidelines and crash risk assessment tools
(including production or improvement of a road safety audit manual and high-risk location
programme guidelines).
Provision of assistance and support for local government authorities, as may be specified in the
legislation and as implied in national road safety action plans.
Guiding further development of road safety policies based on experience in, and feedback from,
regional offices for adoption by the corporate management group.
Supporting the regional offices to establish and monitor access to police crash data and other
safety-related data, and their use of the local data to determine higher crash risk locations and
lengths, and guiding implementation of expanded safety treatment programmes.
Supporting progressive introduction of road safety audit, making arrangements for establishing
auditor accreditation procedures with an independent professional organisation, and
establishing training course requirements.
Obtaining funding and resources for training for the regional programmes.
Regular reporting to corporate management group regarding progress with these
responsibilities.

THE IMPORTANT ROLE OF SUPPORTING PROVINCIAL AND LOCAL
GOVERNMENTS
Local governments will need support in introducing Safe System principles and will also provide input
about how Safe System treatments can be more effectively implemented. The importance of the role of
local governments is illustrated by the example of Indonesia where recent data suggests that more than
70% of road crash fatalities occur on provincial and local roads and streets, not national highways.

In addition, local governments have land use planning responsibilities to control the nature of new
development, access to road reserves, and prevention of illegal development. They also have roadside
management responsibilities to control the unsafe effects of roadside activities. These powers often
extend to national roads in LMICs.

It is often the role of local government, for example, to provide footpaths abutting new road developments
or existing roads. There is a need to consider pedestrian safety issues as well as motorised road user and
cyclist safety. Policies need to be devised and adopted for safe movement of pedestrians along and across
roads and for potential treatments at higher-risk locations. Funding arrangements need to be resolved to
ensure pedestrian facilities are in place or provided.

Simple tools to support improvement of knowledge and capacity at the provincial and local levels will be

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 11/353



needed, as will adequately funding. However, funding arrangements are usually complex and specific to
each jurisdiction.

ACHIEVING ADEQUATE FUNDING
Safe System introduction is likely, over time, to lead to fundamental change in an authority’s approach and
programmes. Cost-effective safety interventions and investment will become a more substantial
component within new projects and maintenance and reconstruction works, and will also support improved
worksite safety management. For all LMICs, understanding and identification of higher crash risk issues
(e.g. through application of proactive network risk assessment programmes and high-risk location analysis)
will increase demand for implementation of treatments. Allocations for road safety funding within annual
budgets in order to respond to these demands will increasingly emerge. Without sustainable and long-term
funding commitment by government (supported by innovative safety programme business case
submissions from the road authority), nothing will change.

Increased funding for safety projects will require linkage to new safety-related corporate KPIs whose
measurement will enable management of effectiveness to occur. Box 7.1 illustrates an approach to
introducing funding of Safe System treatments.

BOX 7.1: EARMARKED AND MAINSTREAM FUNDING FOR SAFE SYSTEM ROAD SAFETY ENGINEERING –
SWEDEN

Road safety in Sweden is mostly funded by government and through general revenue distributed to the
lead agency – now the Swedish Transport Administration (STA) – and other sectors. In 1999, funding to
the lead agency was doubled with a total of SEK 8.5 billion ($US 1.25 billion) to be made available for
road safety over 10 years. An increased and earmarked allocation was made to allow resources for
physical road safety measures such as roads with median guardrails, safer intersections and safer road
shoulders. Road safety engineering is being increasingly brought into the mainstream of infrastructure
development and asset management.

Source: Breen et al., 2008

Obtaining safety funding from other administrations - Opportunities for obtaining targeted funding for road
safety investment (e.g. infrastructure safety works, additional enforcement, public campaigns, and
conferences and seminars) need to be pursued by all agencies, especially health and road authorities,
given the relatively high cost of infrastructure provision and implications of crash outcomes on the health
system.

How to Obtain Safety Dedicated Funding - Obtaining adequate safety funding is a leading responsibility for
a road authority. In particular, it is necessary to draw on sustainable domestic funding sources as far as
practicable. Some examples of possible revenue sources that deserve particular attention are the
introduction of more efficient enforcement mechanisms (automated enforcement) for the collection of
traffic fines and injury insurer contributions, based on achieving a satisfactory rate of economic return on
investment through lower claims experience. In some countries such as Australia, Canada and Sweden, the
injury insurers fund major advertising, research and enforcement programmes and revenue from traffic
infringements (Australia and France) funds major infrastructure programmes.

7.3 IMPACTS OF SAFE SYSTEM ADOPTION ON
ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF A ROAD
AUTHORITY
CHANGED EXPECTATIONS
The goal of Chapter 4. Safe System Approach is that the infrastructure and road environment support a
safe outcome for all road users when they make errors and do so by taking into account human crash
tolerance thresholds.

Policies, guidelines and programmes need to be developed to ensure progressive advancement towards a
network embodying Safe System principles and outcomes. The progressive adoption of Safe System goals
and strategies within the operational practice of road authorities requires considerable investment in
knowledge, skills, policy and guideline development, both by the road authority as an entity and by
individual staff.

More road authorities are recognising the major implications that adoption of a Safe System has. The role
of the road authority is to provide a safe network that will require the progressive reduction of the
traditional trade-offs that have historically been made between safety on the one hand, and mobility and
access on the other. Rather than trade-offs, ‘win-win’ outcomes are required and need to be planned over
time.

Support for infrastructure safety investment in order to achieve non-fatal crash risk conditions across the
network (the spirit of the Safe System Approach) will become the priority. This is likely to result in
substantial increases in the influence of the safety-focused infrastructure compared to other road safety
programmes.

Example: A comparison from Sweden between the Safe System/Vision Zero approach and a traditional
road safety approach as presented in Table 7.1 is instructive.

A NEW SAFE SYSTEM FOCUS FOR PROGRAMMES AND PROJECTS
Road authorities (and all road safety agencies) have to recognise that the framework for understanding
and managing crash risk has to be thoroughly rethought. Existing knowledge of the new framework and
responsibilities for determining and responding to crash risk in many LMICs is inadequate.

As an illustration of authorities recognising the need to make this major adjustment, and in doing so,
Slovenian road safety authorities (Zajc, 2014) express their new approach as shown in Box 7.2.

BOX 7.2: SLOVENIAN ROAD SAFETY MANAGEMENT EXPERIENCE

Previously: The driver must accommodate the traffic system. The driver was treated like a potential
delinquent.

Now: The traffic system must accommodate the driver.

The driver is a victim of the traffic system because she/he has a limited capability for processing all
traffic information. The system must be simple so that the driver makes less mistakes. When the driver
makes mistakes, the system must forgive him and reduce the consequences.

Source: Zajc, 2014

On the other hand, an indicative example of the lack of adequate understanding of crash risk and
appropriate good practice responses within the activities of two road authorities is set out in Box 7.3.

BOX 7.3: SOUTH-EASTERN EUROPEAN ROAD AUTHORITY: NOT ADEQUATELY RECOGNISING RISK

Discussions as part of a road safety capacity review were held with the national road authority in a
south-eastern European country in 2008 to ascertain, among other issues, why barrier linemarking on a
particularly mountainous national road, with a high proportion of heavy vehicle traffic, was only in place

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 14/353



for some 50% of the length required by international overtaking sight distance standards. The response
of the authority was that ‘if the full barrier linemarking were to be installed to meet the safety
standards, it would mean overtaking opportunities would be very limited’. This trade-off between safety
and amenity (or ‘efficiency’ as some would consider it) was not transparent. There had been no
community debate about serious crash risk versus faster journey times. It is an all-too-common
example of safety not being fully supported or being covertly traded-off for other purposes in the past.

The approach adopted in Argentina to implement a Safe System focus is explained in the following case
study.

CASE STUDY - Argentina: Application of the Safe System approach through the creation of
a lead agency

In 2008, the Government of Argentina created the National Road Safety Agency (Agencia Nacional de
Seguridad Vial, ANSV) envisioned as the lead agency on traffic and road safety policy. The challenge
for the newly formed ANSV was to exercise its powers and achieve its mission within a federal
framework that provided for significant provincial and local government autonomy. ANSV’s challenge
included a decentralised registry system for driver’s licenses, no unified traffic infraction records, and
no reliable road crash data. The ANSV’s federal role was institutionalised through its establishment as
a decentralised lead agency with financial autonomy within the Ministry of Interior. The agency’s
‘ownership’ of road safety issues was legitimated through strong partnerships with provincial and
local governments, as well as NGOs and private sector. Read More

POWERS TO MANAGE LAND USE AND DEVELOPMENT IMPACTS
Implementing Safe System principles on major new road projects and, particularly, delivering improvement
in the safety levels of the existing network over time will require, among other measures, adequate
controls on roadside access and roadside activity to be put in place. Necessary powers and government
actions to regulate abutting land use development and roadside activities on existing roads for this
purpose will be required.

Road authorities and local Governments: Processes to assess the safety impact of any proposed land use
development need to be established between the road authority and local governments. Potential safety
issues need to be identified, and a range of responses developed as potential development conditions in
order to minimise future harm. These processes need to be embedded in land use planning and local
government legislation.

Favouring Legislation: Laws to support improved compliance by the public with the decisions of the road
authority/local government in these matters will be required, and these laws need to be enforced.
Consideration should also be given to introducing incentives to encourage local government to adhere to
their land use planning policies. It is essential that the stakeholders understand and accept the need for
legislation to control land use and roadside development and that the road authority:

Has a voice (provided by land use planning legislation) in responding to likely impacts of
proposed development upon the safe operation of the road system.
Has the ability to set appropriate roadside access conditions which will be binding upon
developers and respected by local government as the responsible authority.
Can be assured that roadside development controls will be adequately enforced.
Can be assured that any unapproved activities carried out on the road reserve (such as
hawkers/street traders) will receive prompt and effective enforcement attention by the local
authorities.
Establishes a joint road authority/local government monitoring and enforcement group for each
local authority area.

Box 7.4 sets out a discussion that addresses a number of highly relevant safety concerns in many LMICs
for so-called linear settlements. These common situations reflect inadequate public administration powers
(or their lack of application), leading to highly unsafe road environments especially for vulnerable road
users.

BOX 7.4: LINEAR SETTLEMENTS

A major factor in road fatalities in LMICs is the presence of vulnerable road users on roads abutting so-
called linear settlements. Here, the lack of access control and poorly conceived investment strategies
for road networks (and for the development of communities) has resulted in mixed functions with
residential and business along the country’s main arterial roads, with heavy, high-speed traffic activity.
These ‘coffin roads’ are well-known examples of the problems with linear settlements on busy,
upgraded roads, and which occur in many LMICs.

Vulnerable road users are not the only ones at serious risk. Poorly planned U-turn provisions or
inadequate physical restrictions on U-turns along LMIC highways are a major cause of serious casualty
crashes, especially among the passengers of public transport minibuses (e.g. in Egypt). These U-turn

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 16/353



gaps and poor control of road median crossing movements are a serious road safety problem. This is a
deeply embedded characteristic of the road network in LMICs and requires action across many road
authorities in achieving adequate local government development planning to support safe -of-way
management.

Measures required based on good HIC practice include:

Land use and housing strategies to regulate and prevent such developments abutting busy
roads.
Legal power and instruments for the road administration to enforce access control along
inter-urban roads and freeways.
Infrastructure treatment tools and funding to repair existing dangerous situations, especially
for vulnerable road users.

Source: Vollpracht., 2010

Linear settlement roads result in unsafe conditions, with pedestrians and vehicles continuously entering
and exiting the road from each abutting property frontage. Safe System principles indicate that each
property entry to a roadway function as a minor intersection, creating the potential for -angle crashes
involving vehicles entering or leaving the carriageway colliding with vehicles travelling along the road.

BOX 7.5: LINEAR SETTLEMENT SOLUTIONS – REPUBLIKA SRPSKA, BOSNIA

Linear settlements are frequent in Republika Srpska (and most Balkan countries) and pose a serious
problem, especially for vulnerable road users.

A strategy to address these risks was proposed with two components:

1. An express road system with a 2 + 1 lane cross-section bypassing villages and towns can nearly
halve the price for motorways and will be sufficient for traffic volumes up to 20,000 vehicles/day.
So, the main and safer arterials in Republika Srpska can be built up much earlier than the
planned motorway system. They can be widened later, as soon as the traffic volume needs a
second carriageway.

2. Adapt the existing main and regional roads within linear settlements to a mixed-use function
implementing traffic calming treatments and providing safety facilities for non-motorised users.

Source: Kostic et al., 2013

As outlined above, unauthorised activities carried out on the roadsides, especially on heavily trafficked
routes, need to be regulated and managed to minimise adverse safety impacts for road users. This is an
area of considerable weakness in many LMICs, with traders and vendors occupying the road reserve,
setting up stalls and goods. In urban areas, traders’ goods and itinerant vendors often encroach on
footpaths, forcing pedestrians to use the road for walking. There is often little management of this
unauthorised use by the local government authorities or the police. It is a major challenge for road
authorities to obtain the attention of government and gain their support to change the situation. However,

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 17/353



there are successful examples in LMICs of local governments negotiating relocations of street vendors to
public market spaces, re-established away from the main roads to improve safety.

A STRONG NEED FOR ROAD CLASSIFICATION
Adopting a more safety-sensitive road classification for the network that better matches road function,
speed limit, layout and design is an important aspiration. As noted above, linear urban development is a
characteristic of most LMICs and tends to confound this classification approach. Planning to progress
toward the long-term goal of segregation of road use functions and improvement in operational safety is
important for Safe System adoption. Suitable planning can guide future road investment (for example in
provision of bypass roads) and the associated safety retrofitting of existing roads for their access or
distributor functions.

As previously indicated (see Section 4.6. Safe System: Scientific Safety Principles And Their Application ),
the Sustainable Safety approach from the Netherlands places great emphasis on a strong road
classification system. Road functionality is central to this approach, and it is suggested that roads should
have a single function, whether this be as through roads, distributor roads, or access roads. This concept
has been well understood for many years, but in more recent years there has been an increased
recognition that more needs to be done to ensure this distinction is made. This includes providing an
appropriate classification system, allocating all roads to this, and ensuring that the design, and
understanding by road users is consistent with this function. Further information is provided on this issue

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 18/353



in The Basics: Road user Capacities and Behaviours in Section 8.2. Designing Infrastructure To Encourage
Safe Behaviour , including a discussion on ‘self-explaining roads’ to support road user understanding of
this functional classification.

This emphasis on clear road function and appropriate speed management directly connects to the Roads-
for-Life (R4L) framework defined by the World Bank (Turner et al., 2024). The R4L framework offers a
practical tool for achieving this alignment by providing a methodology for setting safe speed limits based
on evidence and best practices. Unlike traditional methods, R4L considers vulnerable road users (VRUs)
and balances the competing demands of movement and place (Vicroads, 2019), using a practical road
classification structure to determine appropriate speed limits and promote self-enforcement through
infrastructure design. Therefore, R4L directly addresses the need for a more safety-sensitive road
classification system, as advocated by the Sustainable Safety approach, by providing a concrete
framework for its implementation.

The main differences between many of the traditional functional road classification approaches and the
R4L framework are summarized in Table 7.2.

7.4 EMBEDDING THE SAFE SYSTEM IN THE GOALS
AND OPERATIONAL PRACTICE OF ROAD
AUTHORITIES
It is a challenging and potentially lengthy process for a road authority to move from adopting Safe System
principles to fully implementing them into its operations. Progress will be measured in years rather than
months. Embedding a Safe System approach is likely to involve the following steps:

Development of a clear strategic objective or statement of purpose or intent.
Improving Safe System learning and understanding by individuals in the organization.
Corporate processes to define policies and management systems.
Production of a road safety strategy for the road authority plus associated policies and
guidelines to direct required actions.
Network safety management practices to guide the planning, design, operation and
maintenance of the network.
Agreed performance objectives for both the authority and the community and ongoing
assessment of safety outcomes.
Feedback on performance.
Informing the community that this embedding of the Safe System is taking place and what that
means for safe travel.

A summary of some key issues and potential actions or processes associated with moving to embed the
Safe System within a road authority’s management systems is set out in Table 7.3.

Systems principles

At the outset, any existing national road safety strategy will need to be reviewed and if necessary,
adjustments to the strategy made to include the UN Decade of Action for Road Safety’s Safe System basis.
It is expected that many LMICs will need to review the adequacy of their processes (see Establishing
Corporate Processes to Develop Policy in Section 7.4 Embedding the Safe System in the Goals and
Operational Practice of Road Authorities for guidance on this).

The leadership will also need to recognise the changed organisational responsibilities that will flow from
these decisions and consider how to go about providing for these changes. The needs and the
environment in which the road authority in any country is operating will influence the detail of this.

Progress will depend heavily on leadership provided by the chief executive. These are quite challenging
change management tasks, winning the support and commitment of senior management within the
organisation is a key first step and priority.

Training programmes, such as those outlined in Learning and Knowledge Development in Section 7.4
Embedding The Safe System in the Goals and Operational Practice of Road Authorities will be important on

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 21/353



an ongoing basis as improved corporate policies and network management systems are adopted by the
organisation. For any road authority moving to embed Safe System practice, senior and middle
management need sufficient time to learn about and understand the underlying concepts.

The internal communication processes in place to support change management also need to be reviewed
if meaningful change is to be introduced over time. This would include effective communication across all
levels of government and between head and regional offices.

The experience of the Swedish Road Administration in introducing Safe System (Vision Zero) thinking and
moving to implement associated and substantially different infrastructure safety programmes across the
organisation is instructive (see Box 7.6)

BOX 7.6: CHALLENGE OF IMPLEMENTING CHANGE: SWEDISH ROAD AUTHORITY, SWEDEN

From 2000 to 2009, Sweden moved to increase the 2 + 1 cable barrier divided road network on the
more heavily trafficked sections of the national highway network. The length of this treatment
increased from 180 km in 2000 to some 2,120 km in 2009. This was to address the high incidence of
head-on crashes experienced on the network, due in part to the existing 13-metre-wide carriageways
(two through lanes with wide shoulders), which encouraged a form of four-lane driver behaviour,
leading to increased head-on crash risk. Sweden also began to install roadside barriers to address run-
off-road serious crash risk, and to expand programmes to install roundabouts to address serious crash
risks at intersections.

The decision made at head office for barrier expansion, in particular from 2000, took some time to
achieve general compliance and support by all regional managers. In fact, performance targets for
regional managers (for 2 + 1 lanes with wire rope median barriers) were required in order to drive
compliance with corporate policy. Some regional managers considered the policy directives for central
medians and 2 + 1 lane construction to not be in accordance with traditional approaches.

Road fatalities were reduced by 76% (79% if only the links are considered, i.e. excluding fatal crashes in
intersections), establishing 2+1-roads with cable barriers as a globally recognized best practice within
the Vision Zero framework

SETTING A NEW STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE
Box 7.7 outlines an example of a road authority, which sets out the basis for its transformation to an
authority that will fully integrate Safe System thinking into its activities and the associated strategic
objective it has adopted. Main Roads Western Australia (MRWA) is an informed user of the Safe System,
with an understanding of, and experience with, its application. The process MRWA has adopted to guide its
use of Safe System principles within its operations is comprehensive and informative for other road
authorities that are in a similar advanced stage of awareness of the Safe System.

BOX 7.7: MAIN ROADS, WESTERN AUSTRALIA (MRWA) STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE

The vision:

To eliminate death and serious injury crashes on the Western Australian Road network and leave a
lasting legacy of a safe road system for our children, grandchildren and the community.

Strategic objective:

The MRWA road safety strategy The Road Towards Zero is aimed at bringing about changes to our road
safety institutional arrangements, practices and culture as we strive to eliminate death and serious

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 23/353



injury. In doing so it will:

Deliver a safe world-class road system
Embed the Safe System approach into the organisation and road sector
Provide assurance to government and community that we are achieving results.

The Road Towards Zero’s strategic objective reflects this focus on cultural change: To change thinking,
practice and behaviour – to let staff imagine all things possible – to build, maintain and operate an
inherently safe road system.

Source: MRWA, 2011

As indicated earlier, relevant legislation under which the road authority operates will influence the way
that the authority proceeds to implement a Safe System approach.

LEARNING AND KNOWLEDGE DEVELOPMENT
Building awareness of Safe System possibilities and application will be achieved through leadership,
training and knowledge development as discussed in detail in Chapter 4. The Safe System Approach .
Resourcing this awareness building is a critical step for LMICs.

TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT APPROACHES

Effective training and change management activities will be crucial enablers to achieving Safe System
progress. New Zealand, which has a well-advanced Safe System approach has implemented sector-wide
training programmes through the New Zealand Transport Agency (NZTA) (Climo et al., 2014) as presented
in Box 7.8

BOX 7.8: NZTA TRAINING PROGRAMMES

Safer Journeys (the NZ strategy) acknowledged the need to embed the Safe System into New Zealand’s
road safety culture and to develop the capability to do so. Within four years of adopting a Safe System
approach, the NZTA has moved to incorporate Safe System processes within its operations.

A structured ‘culture change’ programme was embarked upon, which provided detail about what it
meant in practice and what it needed to do differently. Supporting resources were developed as follows:

A suite of Safe System pamphlets for road users, system designers, coroners, engineers and
planners.
A series of new Safe System guides for targeting high-risk rural roads, intersections and
motorcycle routes.
A Safe System case study video.
A two-day Safe System in practice workshops aimed at training 500 people in groups of
about 50 over an 18-month period.

A range of existing policy, procedure and guideline documents, likely to have the greatest influence,

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 24/353



were identified and a programme of updating these embarked upon.

The second Safer Journeys Action Plan (2013-15) has continued this focus with specific ‘Advance the
Safe System’ tasks that include:

Undertaking signature projects where a Safe System approach will be taken to address
corridor or community road safety issues.
Establishing a Safe System partnership programme that requires new partnerships to be
formed across local government, the private sector, advocacy groups and communities.
Reframing the road safety conversation to raise the awareness of what really contributes to
road safety.

Source: Climo et al., 2014.

NZTA’s experience has demonstrated that culture change is not a short-term or easy task. It requires
leadership from the highest level such as politicians and chief executives and perseverance, with continual
repetition of simple key messages. It has also been recognised that changing the conversation in the
media, away from the ‘driver blame’ culture, will be critical to success.

Effective staff development will require programmes such as New Zealand’s (above) and other more
‘entry-level’ programmes to be identified and then utilised for relevant professional development of staff,
particularly within LMIC authorities. Activities such as short-term (two-to-four-week duration) staff
exchanges with other national road authorities, and seminars by local and international experts to inform
and obtain input about road safety policy-related matters, should also be pursued.

A continuous change and improvement culture should be fostered, with an extended training programme
for head office staff and the regions being introduced at the appropriate time. These are pivotal steps in
helping to underpin safety knowledge and fostering improvement in safety performance by a road
authority.

INITIATIVES TO SUPPORT SAFE SYSTEM APPLICATION

Initiatives to assist focused application of Safe System principles within road authority programmes and
projects include:

Improved access to data and familiarity with key analysis tools (this requires a reliable crash
data system; see Chapter 5. Effective Management and Use of Safety Data).
Building organisational knowledge.
Understanding that the existing network is not safe, some locations are less safe than others,
and why that is so, including use of tools such as risk assessment (see Chapter 10. Assessing
Potential Risks and Identifying Issues ).
Understanding crash risk and applying the Safe System approach to reducing fatal and serious
injury crash outcomes by crash type.
Establishing and maintaining processes for discussion and decision making (about crash risk
and the Safe System) across the organisation for policy and programme development.
Working to improve safety performance by implementing formalised road safety management
systems or by building upon existing processes used to assess safety.
Continued research into potential infrastructure safety treatment options.

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 25/353



Evaluating programme effectiveness.

CRASH RISK ANALYSIS AND TREATMENT: DEVELOPMENT OF UNDERSTANDING AND APPLICATION

Many professionals within road authorities learn about crash analysis, development of treatment options,
selection of the most cost-effective option (with a focus on reducing fatal and serious injury crashes, as
distinct from all crashes), and implementation, through high-risk location projects and programmes.
However, it would be preferable for a road authority to move as soon as possible to a network-wide
assessment and treatment of crash risk. High risk location treatment projects – which are based on solid
evidence of crash types and robust estimations of project costs and crash reduction benefits, followed by
later evaluation – are a key learning tool for professional road safety engineers that are starting out in road
infrastructure safety. Such projects, as long as they are pursued with a clear Safe System focus and basic
initial understanding, are important steps for individuals along the path to broader understanding of crash
risk and tools.

Examples of demonstration projects in a number of countries by all the road safety agencies, including the
road authority, to improve crash risk analysis and treatment knowledge are provided in Chapter 6. Road
Safety Targets, Investment Strategies Plans and Projects. Further information on the use of crash data for
the identification of high-risk locations can be found in Chapter 10. Assessing Potential Risks and
Identifying Issues.

ESTABLISHING CORPORATE PROCESSES TO DEVELOP POLICY
Change is always challenging and the scale of reassessment or reframing of policies and guidelines
involved with fully embracing the Safe System is substantial. These are large steps for any road authority,
but it is a substantial challenge when a typical LMIC authority embarks on this journey. Moving from
understanding by individuals to adoption of a corporate consensus and then agreeing on the new road
safety vision and how it is to be applied is a challenging process for any road authority. Processes of this
type will be less developed in most LMIC road authorities, but dialogue and discussion need to be
encouraged as soon as possible by their leaders. It is likely to take time and leadership to implement a

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 26/353



significant change to established corporate policy-making processes.

WORKING GROUP PROGRAMME

To support the substantial policy development task of establishing road safety priorities, road authorities in
LMICs could usefully establish working groups to examine issues and develop detailed and implementable
policy recommendations for senior management. Each group would have:

A designated lead officer.
Clear terms of reference.
Access to legal and other expertise.
Consultation with other agencies, as necessary.
A monitored timeframe for reporting final recommendations to senior management.

These working groups would report to senior management, which could be convened as a senior road
safety planning group on a regular basis. Priority policy issues could include:

A speed management policy.
Vulnerable user safety policy – provision of facilities to improve the safety of major at-risk road
user groups (e.g. pedestrians, bicyclists, motorcyclists, etc.) in their movement along and
across national and provincial/state roads.
Revision of road maintenance activities/practices to improve safety.
Provision of Safe System training, including to local government.
Conducting network safety assessment by identifying the extent to which sections of road meet
Safe System principles and key gaps for attention.
Building organisational road safety principles, technical standards and guidelines over time.

PROJECT REVIEW COMMITTEE (PRC) APPROACH

An authority with more developed corporate decision-making processes could follow a Project Review
Committee approach to develop and progress an expanded crash risk reduction programme. The
committee would be made up of the senior engineering executives of the organisation and would review
presentations by project staff on larger proposed projects on a regular (possibly weekly) basis. Project
proponents would be queried on higher-level key issues, (estimated cost, asset management, delivery,
environmental and land acquisition, mobility and access, traffic management and road safety).

Safety discussions would centre on measures proposed to improve safety within new projects or the
existing safety issues on an existing road which is to be upgraded and measures to be taken to address
these. Corporate road safety policies, guidelines and standards would be reviewed and adjusted, or
introduced, as a result of these discussions and associated further reviews.

As indicated in Learning and Knowledge Developments in Section 7.4 Embedding the Safe System in the
Goals and Operational Practice of Road Authorities, the previous exposure to crash-prone location
programmes is relevant, as these activities sensitise a road authority not only to opportunities for
improving levels of safety on the network but also to the disadvantages of only treating high-risk locations,
leaving lower-risk lengths untreated and less likely to be treated.

The Project Review Committee approach recognises that embedding the Safe System requires an
organisation-wide dialogue at the senior management level about network operating responsibilities, as

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 27/353



well as a similar dialogue at project or programme-specific levels (e.g. where bicycle paths along existing
arterial roads should be located on the cross-section of an upgrade or new road project).

PRODUCING POLICIES AND GUIDELINES
The production of quality policies, guidelines and standards follows as a next step. These will be developed
over time and will be quite varied in nature, reflecting the stage of safety development of a road authority
and its immediate safety priorities. Further advice on the role of policies, standards and tools and their
development is provided in Chapter 9, Infrastructure Safety Management: Policies, Standards, Guidelines
and Tools along with examples.

Priority areas for policy development and associated training would be:

Safe System guidance; road design (embedding these Safe System concepts)
Traffic management which supports safe network operation
Safe work-site management
High risk location criteria and road audits to identify crash-prone sites, followed by analysis,
evaluation, and treatment (to be followed by network risk analysis when tools are able to be
utilised and projects can be funded).

An Example: Some road-safety-related policy gaps that were identified as needing to be addressed by the
Indonesian Directorate General of Highways (DGH) in a review in 2013 of the overall strategic plan are
summarised below. They are down to earth, practical policy initiatives, including:

Reference the National Road Safety Master Plan in the overall DGH Strategic Plan.
Reference the Safe System approach within the overall Strategic Plan.
Develop safety-related indicators in organisational key performance indicators (KPIs) (‘what is
not measured is not managed’).
Introduce a funding category for specific safety investments (crash-prone locations) to support
identification of comparative funding effort.
Revise road-safety-related design standards.
Provide supplementary project funding to meet additional items identified as necessary in late-
stage road safety audits.

For road authorities in LMICs, priority safety issues for policy attention and implementation will often differ
from priorities for HIC authorities. For LMICs, policy priorities will usually include:

Providing pedestrian and motorcycle facilities which improve safety outcomes.
Addressing incompatible speeds between road users in areas of high risk.
Installing traffic management and infrastructure safety measures to reduce crash risk.
Controlling vehicle access to/from roadsides.
Controlling land use developments abutting arterial roads to reduce adverse safety impacts.
Improving safety of operation of heavy vehicles.
Improving compliance with road rules.

As an example, the City of Abu Dhabi has worked to develop urban design guidelines for application across
the urban streets of the city to improve sustainable safety and amenity for pedestrians, public transit users

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 28/353



and cyclists and give these road users priority through these treatments. This outlined in the case study
below.

CASE STUDY - Abu Dhabi: Urban street design manual

The Emirate of Abu Dhabi has a diverse population with unique driver behaviours and varying levels
of driving education and cultural differences. The Abu Dhabi Urban Planning a growing population and
desired to improve pedestrian facilities to create a safe street with more walkable environments in an
effort to transition to a multi-modal society.

The solution: The UPC commissioned the Abu Dhabi Urban Street Design Manual to address these
needs. The Manual is now part of the UPC’s development regulations and required to be used in
conjunction with other adopted standards and guidelines. Read More

APPLYING THE SAFE SYSTEM WITHIN NETWORK MANAGEMENT PRATICE
The steps outlined in Setting a New Strategic Objective to Producing Policies and Guidelines from Section
7.4 Embedding the Safe System in the Goals and Operational Practice of Road Authorities will provide the
guidance required for embedding the Safe System within management and operation of the network.
However, there is another step required of road authorities. They need to progressively apply the policies
they are developing and to build supportive management systems to ensure their network management
activities incorporate all the guidance they have prepared.

A road authority will need to take steps to incorporate safety management systems within its network
planning and operations. This can be pursued through measures such as:

Review of programmes and priorities when annual programme guidelines are prepared and
when annual business planning is taking place.
Periodic review of progressive implementation of safety policies and guidelines.

Some formalisation of this approach is recommended in time and ISO 39001 provides guidance on how to
structure this (see Interventions in Section 3.2. Management System Frameworks and Tools ).

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 29/353



MANAGING PERFORMANCE
A road authority will need to progressively assure itself and the community that it is making progress with
improving its network safety management and operation. This assurance can be sought through:

Periodic evaluation of programmes to determine their safety benefits.
Use of safety performance indicators – a limited set initially, developing to a more sophisticated
system later – to measure specific areas of progress.
Feeding results of evaluation and measurement (positive and negative) into programme
guideline review and annual business planning activity.
Trends in fatal crashes on the network over a number of years.

For most LMICs, the identification and adoption of specific safety KPIs will be a useful way to measure
performance and build accountability over time.

SAFETY KPIS AND BUDGET ALLOCATIONS

All road safety strategies should have specific KPIs. The introduction of KPIs allows authorities to specify
the level of improved road safety achievement sought and/or to encourage active development and
achievement of road safety improvement programmes.

One consequence of a lack of high-level road safety KPIs can be the absence of an identifiable separate
budget allocation for specific road safety programmes. Funding allocation categories within LMIC road
authorities typically include routine maintenance, periodic maintenance, rehabilitation and reconstruction.

One of the benefits of a separate allocation for specific safety programmes is the ability to measure overall
expenditure on targeted safety works and to determine economic return on investment.

Good network safety performance needs to be considered a major organisational output for a road
authority. Over time, safety-related corporate-level KPIs are likely to move from initial introduction in many

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 30/353



LMICs to ‘centre stage’ importance in the authority’s overall performance assessment.

A range of more detailed performance indicators will need to be developed to enable progress with
implementation of infrastructure safety treatments. Once KPIs are agreed it is necessary to establish how
they will be measured and reported, and determine the frequency at which this will take place (see
performance indicators discussion in Chapter 3. The Road Safety Management System, Chapter 5.
Effective Management and Use of Safety Data and Chapter 6. Road Safety Targets, Investment Strategies
Plans and Projects ). Example KPIs from the Global Plan are provided in Box 7.9.

BOX 7.9: GLOBAL PERFORMANCE INDICATORS FOR SAFER ROADS AND MOBILITY

The Global Framework Plan of Action for Road Safety introduces various indicators for monitoring the
implementation of the national action plan, such as:

Annual number of roadside checks and other checks.
Annual number of citations for offending traffic rules (by infringement: speed, non-use of
helmet, non-use of child restraint, non-use of safety belt, excessive use of
alcohol/psychoactive substances, use of mobile phone while driving, blocking public spaces,
etc.).
Annual number of issued driving permits.
Annual number of driver exams.
Annual number of withdrawn drivers permits (by infringement).
Number of registered vehicles.
Annual number of periodic technical inspection.
Annual number of withdrawn registration certificates.
Proportion of vehicles in circulation meeting required technical standards.
Proportion of new or imported (used) vehicles meeting required technical standards
Proportion of vehicles in circulation that have successfully passed periodical technical
inspections.
Annual number of licenses issued/withdrawn to/from inspection centers.
Length of the roads by category.
Annual change in the length of the road.
Annual number of road audits and inspections.
Proportions of road kilometres audited or inspected.
Length or proportion of roads that passed inspection (meet the required technical standard).
Annual number of licenses issued/withdrawn to/from audit/inspection bodies.
Annual changes to budgets of road safety authorities.
Annual average post-crash response time.
Proportion of MDCI to all crash investigations.
Annual number of outreach and awareness raising activities (by topic).
Number of training activities for vehicle inspectors, road auditors and inspectors,
professional emergency services.

7.5 DELIVERING PROGRAMMES AND PROJECTS
PROGRAMME GUIDELINES
Programme guidelines are specifications for use by road authority staff of the elements within a potential
programme that are to be developed and funded on a priority basis (usually on the basis of benefit-cost
ratio or net present value; see Chapter 11. Intervention Selection and Prioritisation). They are used by
many road authorities to guide preparation of projects that are to be considered in a corporate approval
process in various programme funding categories for the coming financial year.

Their development is usually a cooperative process between the relevant central policy area and the
regions of a road authority; such processes are required to develop and deliver the approved projects as
components of the particular programme. They represent the specification of the proposed annual activity
programme which has been agreed between core business areas, regional offices and corporate level, and
enable regions to bid in detail for categories of project funding.

An example of this is the introduction of a safety-focused maintenance policy that embeds safety
performance criteria in the agreed levels of service of the road network. Modification of these existing
practices can deliver measurable safety improvement across the network over time. A review of existing
practices and identification of ways to modify current practice to deliver a safer network at the same or
similar levels of cost could be carried out as part of annual programme guideline development.

Effective programme guidelines require sufficient lead time for development, and then are used to assist
the generation of the annual programme for review, consideration and prioritisation during the budget
development period.

There are many variants to this process in different authorities. The important elements are:

Ongoing discussions between the centre (head office) and the regions to agree on guideline
details and emphasis.
Clarity of language and purpose.
Guidance on project detail in terms of risk to be addressed and nature of potential treatments.
Guidance on programme scale (likely funding).
Review of projects for compliance with guidelines, at bidding time and at project budget bid
consideration time.
Use of outcomes from projects to progressively inform programme development and delivery.

It takes time and effort to set up arrangements for new programmes with which the road authority is
comfortable. It is suggested that simpler programmes (both development and delivery) in the initial years
of development can assist with this transition, especially for LMICs.

Starting with projects that are more straightforward in nature (such as crash-prone or high-risk road
lengths identification and treatment on the existing network and road safety audit activity for new
projects) offer a good initial learning platform.

The commencement of safety programmes with crash-prone location treatments enables staff to
understand the necessary analysis of crash costs, the impacts of specific treatment types (such as

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 32/353



roundabouts or hard- shoulder widening), and the crash cost reduction benefits of those treatments. As
outlined in Establishing Corporate Processes to Develop Policy in Section 7.4 Embedding the Safe System
in the Goals and Operational Practice of Road Authorities these are necessary skill sets required before a
road authority moves on to crash-risk-based identification, and analysis and treatment of network lengths
and routes to achieve crash reduction benefits.

Success in the initial years with a simpler programme is likely to lead to increased support for the road
safety improvement task from the community and government and to further funding.

8. DESIGN FOR ROAD USER CHARACTERISTICS
AND COMPLIANCE

KEY MESSAGES
‘Human Factors’ is a well-established scientific term in use since the 1930s by the safety
community of man-machine-interaction. Human Factors is defined as those psychological
and physiological threshold limit values that are verified as contributing to operational
mistakes in machine and vehicle handling.
Unless roads are designed and managed to take account of Human Factors, it is unlikely
that a Safe System can be achieved.
Speed management is one key step towards creating a Safe System. Speeds are the result
of road design and the resulting subconscious choices made by road users. Speed can be
heavily influenced by the number of contrasts in the periphery of the field of view (e.g., by
signs and markings), by the size of the visible road surface and the distance of the fixation
point in the depth of the field of view.
Two additional and until yet not systematically practiced key steps are the management
of the field of view and the pre-programming of driver expectations. That's why road
engineers have to be trained in psychological basics of activity regulation (perception,
cognitive processing and motor response).
A skilful combination of design elements can create ‘self-explaining’ roads where
appropriate actions, including speed choice, are obvious to road users. Self-explaining
roads lead road users to behave in a way that road planners and designers expect,
thereby resulting in low crash rates.
In addition to road design, a range of techniques for directly influencing road user
behaviour are available, including education, publicity, in-vehicle technology and
enforcement.
Good practice in each of the above areas is now well-understood, and guides to good
practice are available.

8.1 INTRODUCTION
THE CHALLENGE
Roads are provided to cater for the movement of people and resources between destinations, i.e. to
provide for mobility and access. Particularly in LMICs, roadside trading and social interaction continues to
be an essential third function for parts of the road network. In these countries, the benefits of dedicating
public spaces, where sociability rather than mobility is the priority, are being increasingly recognised.
Mobility, accessibility, and commercial/social interaction are therefore the three key human uses that
roads have to be designed and managed to serve.

Earlier chapters introduced the concepts of the Safe System and of safe travel as a product, which requires
certain actions to produce it. Safe products must match the needs, capacities and expectations of their
human users and roads are no exception. This chapter outlines how to create a road system that takes
account of human characteristics.

However, Human Factors cannot be considered independently from the other two components of the
system, environment and vehicle.

Human Factors are a well-established scientific endeavour that has influenced developments in many
areas of technology. Its application to road safety issues in a formal sense goes back to at least the 1930s
(e.g. Forbes, 1939). Contemporary understanding of issues, such as the time it takes to perceive and
detect any critical location that challenges the driver to adapt his driving programme and to make a new
decision, the desired luminance, size and contrast between objects and the background needed to resolve
detail, and the rate that information is absorbed, should underpin key standards in road design. Other
important demands for road design arise from the holistic perception of the road user within the road
environment. From there, essential design principles of ‘Gestalt’ have to be included in the technical
design considerations (see Key Sources on Human Factors and Road Design later in this section). This
understanding of the laws of human perception and activity regulation that includes the decision-making
capacity of the road user allows for the development of design and operational specifications for the road
system. This includes elements such as:

Sight distance requirements.
Lighting criteria.
Design and dimensions of road signs.
Spacing between successive decision points.

By effectively doing so, road users can navigate the road system safely and comfortably. Since knowledge
in Human Factors continues to evolve, many of its findings remain to be absorbed in technical standards
and guidelines of the road infrastructure profession. This chapter seeks to introduce the concept of Human
Factors, relate it to Safe System principles, and explain how Human Factors can be applied to create a
safer road system. Human Factors is the generic term for those psychological and physiological threshold
limit values which are verified as contributing to operational mistakes in machine and vehicle handling. It
deals with general and stable subconscious reactions of common road users and excludes temporary
individual reactions and conditions. From there can be derived essential conclusions for basic design
principles that are until now not well established in current national design guidelines (PIARC, 2012b).

FIGURE 8.1: HUMAN FACTORS IN THE SYSTEM OF ROAD SAFETY (SOURCE: BORSOS ET AL., 2015)

In road safety, Human Factors are concerned with the interaction between human road users and the
roadway system elements. The distinction is often made between unintended errors and disobedience of
road rules. Unintended errors tend to occur when road users misperceive some aspect of the road system,
they do not have enough time to react to changing situations, or they are confronted with unexpected
situations. These issues and the means of remedying them are discussed in Section 8.2 Designing
Infrastructure to Encourage Safe Behaviour.

Disobedience of the road rules often occurs when the road system does not adequately meet road users’
needs, e.g. when there are long waiting times to cross at signalised pedestrian crossings. However,
disobedience of the road rules may also occur when users do not understand what they are supposed to
do or understand the benefits of compliance. This is particularly the case in LMICs as they rapidly motorise
and upgrade their road networks and sometimes may not have the signs, road markings or systems in
place to guide and inform those driving, walking or cycling. Disobedience may also occur because some
road users believe they can gain a benefit (such as a faster journey or a more convenient parking or
unloading spot) without incurring any penalty. These issues and some of the implications they have for
infrastructure provision are discussed in Section 8.3 Other Means of Encouraging Road Users to Behave
According to the Rules.

Human Factors are not the same as we commonly understand human behaviour or human performance to
be. So, the questions of personality traits like aggression, the will to violate traffic rules consciously or
mistakes because of medication or age has to be regarded separately. From there can be derived essential
conclusions for basic principles of driver's education, campaigns for influencing driving behaviour and
enforcement. The AASHTO Highway Safety Manual (AASHTO, 2025) states that Human Factors issues
include contributing factors to crashes that generally reflect mismatches between the demands placed on
the road user by roadway design and traffic engineering features, and the inherent physical, perceptual,
and cognitive capabilities and limitations of road users (Brown et al., 2022). Driver behaviour issues

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 38/353



include contributing factors to crashes that generally reflect deliberate violations of law or safe driving
practices such as texting while driving, inattention, or driving while impaired by alcohol. When ‘Human
Factors’ and ‘driver behaviour’ issues are conflated by practitioners, more blame for the crash is placed on
what is believed to be misbehaviour than on the interactions between road demands and driver
capabilities. This approach can have the effect of leaving the real Human Factors issues (e.g. limited
visibility, high workload, limited time to react) on their roadways unidentified and unaddressed.
Information related to this concept are provided in the following sections:

Design measures to create a self-explaining and failure-forgiving road according to the Human
Factors needs of road users, are described in Section 8.2 Designing Infrastructure to Encourage
Safe Behaviour.
Measures relating to communication, education and enforcement including special warning
signs and campaigns are described in Section 8.3 Other Means of Encouraging Road Users to
Behave According to the Rules.

HUMAN FACTORS AND THE SAFE SYSTEM
Human Factors have a key role to play in achieving Safe System requirements.

Safe System principles require that no road users are killed or seriously injured. In an ideal system,
collisions would not occur because the road is designed according to the needs of perception, cognitive
processing and motor response for all the users. However, this is unlikely to be fully achieved as long as
humans directly control vehicles and many roads are not designed in line with the needs of road users,
such as in cases where speeds and road context call for the separation of road users. Even with the advent
of autonomous and connected transportation, human control is still likely for some time into the future. In
addition, there will be a transition period where some vehicles will have advanced technology, while others
will not.

Efforts should therefore be made to help road users perceive the road correctly and to make decisions
about driving, riding or walking that are safe for themselves and other road users. Applying the Human
Factors principles described in the remainder of this section can contribute to achieving a collision-free
road network, but it must be recognised that improving guidance will not always succeed in preventing
collisions. That being the case, space to correct mistakes should be provided where possible, e.g. by
having lane widths that allow some manoeuvre space, providing sealed shoulders, or by having stop lines
some metres in advance of the walkway on pedestrian crossings so long as those changes do not
adversely increase operating speeds. Adequate recovery space will reduce the number and severity of
impacts; however, it will not always succeed in preventing impacts. Therefore, the Safe System requires
forgiving infrastructure and forgiving vehicles so that when collisions do occur, they will not result in
fatalities or non-recoverable injuries.

In summary, achieving Safe System requirements is possible if the combination of human, environmental
and machine (vehicle) factors is addressed appropriately.

KEY SOURCES ON HUMAN FACTORS AND ROAD DESIGN
The NCHRP report ‘Human Factors Guidelines for Road Systems’ (HFGRS) (National Academies, 2012) is a
comprehensive source on Human Factors and road system design and management concerning the
reaction time needs of road users. It is intended to supplement the primary design references and
standards, so that designers who do not have an extensive Human Factors background will be better able

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 39/353



to take account of road user reaction time capabilities and limitations in the application of these standards.
NCHRP has also published a report that considers human factors as part of countermeasure selection
(National Academies, 2024). The document was developed to improve countermeasure selection by
increasing the understanding the contributing factors leading to crashes, including human factors and
behaviours.

PIARC has published a Human Factors document – Human Factors Principles of Spatial Perception for Safer
Road Infrastructure (HFPSP) (PIARC, 2019). It is the most comprehensive approach to illustrate in a
practical way the needs of road users for proper reaction time, for reliable guidance and stabilisation of
user’s field of view and to pre-program user’s expectations so that mistakes can be avoided by design. It is
based on the state of the art of human sciences, especially on the Gestalt principles of the Gestalt
psychology.

When trying to make sense of the world, Gestalt psychology suggests that we tend to perceive things as a
whole rather than as individual components as a way to more efficiently process information and make
sense of our environment. Gestalt is the impression of content of perception that is clearly distinguishable
from its background of scenery and the details of which are so integrated as to constitute a functional unit
with properties not derived from the summation of its parts. It aligns well with Safe System principles and
advocates a proactive approach to safety management, with the aim of designing roads so that crashes
are unlikely. The HFPSP guide provides a powerful and convenient method for applying Human Factors
principles to a wide range of situations that are likely to be encountered by drivers. It does not explicitly
consider pedestrians or other vulnerable road users as active participants in the traffic system. However,
the essential principles are also applicable to these road users, and the reader is encouraged to do so in
cases where it is appropriate in their own practice.

The ‘Human factors guidelines for a safer man-road interface’ (PIARC, 2016b) presents the Human Factors
concept which highlights how road characteristics influence a driver's or wrong driving actions. The
guideline explains the relationship between several road characteristics that trigger wrong perception and
therefore also wrong driving reactions, most of which happen subconsciously. The guideline contains
detailed examples and sketches to help practitioners gain an understanding of the relationship between
misleading and irritating road characteristics and operational mistakes. Better understanding the Human
Factors relationship to road safety allows for an ‘on-the-spot’ investigation of high-risk locations or single
vehicle crashes or in road safety inspections (RSI). This information is also valuable in the planning and
design processes in road safety audits (RSA). More details on RSI and RSA can be found in Section 10.4
Proactive Identification.

These documents provide powerful and convenient methods for applying human factors principles to a
wide range of situations that are likely to be encountered by drivers. The following illustration outlines the
damage and prevention-oriented crash approaches (Birth et al., 2004).

FIGURE 8.2: DAMAGE AND PREVENTION ORIENTED CRASH APPROACHES (SOURCE: BIRTH ET AL., 2004)

A road crash is generally the end-result of a multi-step process (Figure 8.3). By changing actions that are
taken at any of these steps, a crash may or may not be avoided (Figure 8.4). Human factor specialists seek
to understand the contribution of humans in road crashes in order to propose solutions that will break the
chain leading to crashes. Analysis has to begin at the starting point (not just at the impact point) to better
understand how these events occur.

8.2 DESIGNING INFRASTRUCTURE TO
ENCOURAGE SAFE BEHAVIOUR
THE BASICS: ROAD USER CAPACITIES AND BEHAVIOURS ACCORDING TO
HUMAN FACTORS NEEDS
The demand of self-explaining design of Human-Machine Interfaces has produced a revolution in operating
computers, machines and phones. The principles of an intuitive design that suggests users can use their
mobiles or tablets reliably without further instruction are nowadays very common. In analogy to that, a
self-explaining road design should be as intuitive as possible for the road user so that danger symbols,
prohibition and requirement signs are not required any more in the Man-Road Interface. So, it is not only
important to build up a clear system of road categories to inform the driver about the appropriate speed or
to set speed limits. A road's Gestalt should also provide a clear impression of how to drive and it should
pre-program driver’s expectations so that they are never surprised or encouraged to take any risk. The
information presented below are findings from Germany from 1,400 crash locations. This study found the
following three human factors elements essential for self-explaining roads.

REQUIREMENT NO.1: GIVE ROAD USERS ENOUGH TIME

The time it takes an average driver to adapt from one traffic situation to the next, or to adjust to new
requirements, is much longer than what is stated in many current guidelines. Because humans are not
constantly alert and searching for new information, they need more time. This is especially true when
information is difficult to find or is unusual, or when the driver is confronted with complex decisions, or
when unusual manoeuvres are required. Instead of one or two second (simple ‘stimulus-reaction time’) it
takes the average driver at minimum 4-6 seconds to adapt to a new driving requirement (‘anticipation-
response time’ – PIARC, 2012b). Providing the driver with more time to perceive, decide and respond to
the road and conditions is one of the most important means to improve safety. At 100 km/h, the distance
covered before the vehicle can be brought to a complete stop is up to 300 m, considering the entire
braking distance (note that this may take longer if braking is slow due to a wet road or other
circumstances).

FIGURE 8.5: INTERSECTION NOT VISIBLE 125 M AHEAD: UNEXPECTED BRAKING AND HIGH-SPEED CAUSE
OF REAR-END COLLISIONS (SOURCE: BIRTH ET AL., 2004)

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 43/353





A user-friendly road will give drivers the necessary time to adapt to new and unexpected situations. It will
give them the time they need to safely reorganise their driving program. That is why it is not enough to
provide the driver with a reaction time of 2-3 seconds (Stopping Sight Distance, SSD, with manoeuvre
section and response section). The design should also provide an anticipation section with a minimum 2-3
seconds to identify an unexpected or unusual situation with more complex decision demands (Decision
Sight Distance, DSD). In situations that are more complex or involve higher speeds, it is recommended to
have an advance warning section with proper signing and instructions.

A driver changes the driving programme in three easily distinguishable, consecutive logical phases:

1. Anticipation: Identification of the critical location. The critical location is any requirement to adapt
the driving programme.

2. Response (detection, decision): Detection of the precise kind of the required driving action
(steering, braking, acceleration, etc.). Decision for the appropriate driving programme. Start of the
new driving programme (‘change’). Checking, testing and correction of the driving action.

3. Manoeuvre: Technical time to brake / slow down (it depends on the vehicle’s technical condition,
weather and interaction between vehicle and road).

Since the process may take up to 6 seconds, the necessary change in the driving programme has to be
conveyed to the driver 6 seconds ahead to the critical location.

Frequent critical locations requiring an adaptation of the driving programme are:

Junctions or crossings, e.g. crossings with/without traffic signals (railway, bicycles, pedestrians).
Access from private streets/parking places/ farm tracks to main roads.
Road curves.
Cross section narrowing (e.g. at road works or narrow bridges).
Lane losses/merges.
Bus/tram stops.
Motorway entrances/exits.
Entrances to towns/villages.
Changes from a mono-functional road to a road with several mixed functions.
Etc.

The usual ways to avoid critical situations in practice are to:

Eliminate the problem by providing an unobstructed view of the critical locations. Remove

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 46/353



visual obstacles such as crests, curves, vegetation and buildings prior to critical locations. If
useful, construct well detectable traffic islands.
Reduce the problem by implementing treatment that guide a driver's attention directly to the
critical driving demand (if the problem cannot be eliminated). Use attention guiding clues such
as coloured road surfaces, pavement markings, and other advisory treatments.
Minimise the problem, if attention cannot be drawn to the critical point warn road users by
installing traffic control devices such as speed limits, pedestrian crossing facilities, road
markings or signs to prevent overtaking.

Additional good solutions and best practice examples can be found in the PIARC Report ‘Human Factors in
Road Design. Review of Design Standards in Nine Countries’ (PIARC, 2012b).

It is important to recognise the factors that may affect the driver's ability to anticipate, perceive and react
to given situations and conditions. TABLE 8.1 provides examples of driver and situational/environmental
conditions that can influence ability to perceive and react to a condition, which highlights the importance
of the six second requirement.

TABLE 8.1: EXAMPLE OF DRIVER AND SITUATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES THAT CAN INFLUENCE
PERCEPTION-RESPONSE TIME (PRT)



The NCHRP report ‘Human Factors Guidelines for Road Systems’ (HFGRS) (National Academies, 2012) note
that expectancy, conspicuity, and speed are notable factors in perception reaction.

Expectancy is important to driver response when a road is self-explaining, the driver knows what to expect
from the road, and sudden changes are reduced. Sudden changes require extra processing time (e.g.,
sudden curves, high volume pedestrian crossings, significant speed reductions). A designer should take
time to consider what the driver is expecting to see given the past experience and adjust or inform
accordingly.

Conspicuity or the ability to be seen or noticed is an important concept in road design and operation. A

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 47/353



conspicuous object is one that the driver can detect. Failure in detection leads to crashes. Issues that
reduce conspicuity to drivers include objects that are off-axis or not in the driver's line of sight, or cone of
view. Items that blend in with their background or have diminished contrast make them difficulty to
identify. The size of the object, such as those objects that are very small or very similar to their
surrounding items can create challenges as they become camouflaged. In some locations, visual clutter,
such as multiple signs, messages, confusing information or complexity are influencers, particularly at
locations requiring multiple decisions, such as intersections, interchanges or curves.

Speed is important. As has been suggested earlier, the faster one is driving, the further they travel in a
shorter timeframe before encountering a decision point or object. While speeds influence driver speed
choice, other important infrastructure elements (e.g., shoulders, lane widths, vegetation, roundabouts, and
curvature) can influence driver speed choice. Drivers will view the speedometer but use other visual,
auditory and tactile stimuli to select speeds. Drivers use perceptual and message cues to select speeds.
Drivers can also misjudge speeds in some environment such as rural environments without trees or
entering into a lower speed environment after travelling many kilometres on a high-speed environment
such as rural to suburban transition zones.

REQUIREMENT NO.2: THE ROAD MUST PROVIDE A SAFE FIELD OF VIEW

Monotonous, clouded, deceptive or distracting impressions affect the quality of driving. The road, together
with its surrounding field, offers an integrated field of view. This can either stabilise or destabilise the
driver; it can tire or stimulate them. It can also result in either increased or reduced speed. Speed, lane-
keeping and reliability of direction are functions of the quality of the field of view.

A user-friendly road will give drivers a well-designed field of view with sufficient contrasts to increase
alertness. It will provide good optical guiding and orienting facilities with symmetrical and orthogonal
impression.

A good-quality field of view safeguards the driver and keeps him from drifting to the edge of the lane or
even leaving it. Misleading eye-catching objects in the periphery of the field of view activate subconscious
changes in direction. The most serious consequences arise from eye-catching objects that differ from the
road axis. These lead in extreme cases to a horizontal swing of the complete field of view. The driver has
the feeling that the road and its surroundings are moving while he is in an unmoved position. Such objects
lead to gross mistakes in steering. At minimum they lead to disturbances in lane-keeping, though these
can mostly be corrected (for this reason billboards near interurban roads that catch driver’s attention to a
wrong direction should be forbidden like in Germany and on Italian motorways).

An experienced and Human Factors trained designer will avoid monotony in curvature and visual
appearance. They will avoid optical illusions or misleading objects that destabilise drivers and negatively
impact their driving and will take advantage of the optical perception to influence the driver's choice of
speed.

Factors that are forming a safe field of view include the following characteristics:

a) Density of the field of view

The amount of information also influences driver’s speed. The term used for this is density of the field of
view. It is a function of the number of objects that contrast with the background. The presence of very few
contrasting objects leads to monotony as well as reduced performance and reactivity. To avoid monotony
the driver subconsciously changes his driving activities in order to increase information input: he swerves,

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 48/353



brakes or – in most cases – increases speed. Consequently, it is desirable to achieve an optimal level of
bness and colour-contrast (optical density) to support the correct choice of speed. That is why efficient
speed management relies on changing bness and colour-contrasts to avoid subconscious speeding up.

FIGURE 8.12: DENSITY OF THE FIELD OF VIEW IS LOW: MONOTONOUS AND LONG STRAIGHT-AHEAD
SECTION STIMULATE SUBCONSCIOUS SPEEDING UP (SOURCE: BIRTH ET AL., 2004)



The convergence of orientation lines leads to incorrect estimations of object sizes such as lane width
(Figure 8.13).

FIGURE 8.13: OPTICAL ILLUSIONS - LANE WIDTH (SOURCE: GOLDSTEIN, 1997)

b) Lateral space structure

It is proven, that the lateral field of view and its information provide the most important information to
master the difficult task to hold balance on the road like on a balance beam.

If designers fail to take this fact into account, they may not make the prediction about how the finished
design will influence lane-keeping. To hold balance on the road (as on the balance beam) drivers need a
clear orthogonal orientation out of objects in their periphery.

Orthogonal objects or structures calibrate the equilibrioception of road users that is needed for lane-

tracking. Equilibrioception is the perception of the position of an organism in the space with the help of the
eyes (visual system), ears (vestibular system) and the body's sense of where it is in space
(proprioception). Structures over the road like bridges, advertising, signalling and toll facilities should be
symmetrical, of equal height, and the angle of skew to the own road should be less than 15° from
perpendicular.

It was found at crash scenes that asymmetrical posts of a bridge or pitched bridges/advertisements
confuse and disorientate drivers with regard to lane-keeping and result in run-off-road crashes.

Driving reliably through a curve also critically depends on the quality of the field of view and a clear
distinguishable Gestalt of the curve. Best driving results are achieved when the driver has an unobstructed
view over the inner curve and the outer curve has a closed optical framing that provides with its Gestalt a
clear instruction that there is a curve at all. It provides also clear information about the sharpness of the
curve.

c) Depth of the field of view

The driver orientates themselves in the environment that surrounds them. To estimate their position
relative to the road and to their surrounding and to other drivers, they depend on their changes of
position, the changing view axis and the changing points/lines of reference in the environment. The most
serious consequences arise from eye-catching objects that differ from the road axis. These lead in extreme
cases to a horizontal swing of the complete field of view.

All lateral orientation clues should be parallel to the road edge, regularly spaced and equally sized to
stabilise lane-tracking. This is important for markings, hard shoulders, side strips, safety barriers, snow and
wildlife fences, plantings, bicycle ridings and rescue paths and also for public maintenance roads. It was
found at high risk locations that non-parallel orientation lines lead to the impression of prolonged (if lines
are converging) or shortened (if lines are diverging) distances up to critical locations. Optical illusions
cause subconscious swerving, sudden driving manoeuvres and technically ‘unexplainable’ run-of road
crashes. The word illusion comes from the Latin verb illudere, meaning ‘to mock’. Illusions are the result of
the complex information processing of the brain and the visual system that tricks us into perceiving
something as different from what it actually is. Thus, what we see does not correspond to physical reality.

FIGURE 8.16: DISTANCE ILLUSION AT AN ACCIDENT POINT A CRASH LOCATION (SOURCE: BIRTH, 2000)



The combination of a horizontal curve with a vertical sag curve suggests a wider horizontal curve radius
than in reality. Drivers who prepare to steer for a wider curve suddenly have to slow down and correct
their steering when approaching the curve. This is a crash-prone situation that should be avoided.

Conversely, the combination of a horizontal curve with a vertical crest curve suggests a narrower radius
than in reality. This situation is much safer compared to the previous (Figure 8.17).

FIGURE 8.17: OPTICAL ILLUSION – COMBINATION OF HORIZONTAL AND VERTICAL CURVES



These mistakes can be addressed by the following measures:

Eliminate the problem by redesigning the road and its field of view: create sinuous ‘rhythmic’
road alignment against monotony; create symmetry of superstructures by constructive
measures, etc.
Correct the field of view (if the problem cannot be eliminated), e.g. by the use attention guiding
eye-catching objects along the view axis, cover eye-catching objects that differ from the road
axis, create a complete framing of outer curves, avoid visibility barriers in inner curves, cover
non-parallel optical guiding lines that lead to optical illusions, etc.
Minimise the risk by warning road users (if satisfactory correction cannot be achieved) by
installing traffic control devices such as speed limits, prohibiting overtaking or pedestrian
crossing facilities.

Additional good solutions and best practice examples can be found in the PIARC’s Report (PIARC, 2012b)
‘Human Factors in Road Design. Review of Design Standards in nine Countries’.

d) Focus, peripheral vision

There is a relationship between the focus distance and speed (Figure 8.18). When speeds need to be kept
low (e.g. residential areas), roads should be designed to avoid long focus distances (Figure 8.20).

The faster the speed, the narrower is the field of view (Figure 8.19). This should be taken into
consideration when choosing the lateral offset distance of road signs. However, road designers should
make sure that road sign poles do not become in themselves a road hazard.

FIGURE 8.18: SPEED AND FOCUS POINT (SOURCE: COHEN, 1984)  FIGURE 8.19: SPEED AND PERIPHERAL VISION (SOURCE: LEUTZBACH & PAPAVASILIOU,1988)

The longer a straight-ahead section of a road is, the farer the driver will have his fixation location on the
horizon. The automatic effect of that condition is a subconscious speeding up. That is why a Human
Factors experienced designer will limit the length of straight sections especially before intersections or
other critical locations, to avoid subconscious speeding up.

Several crashes occurred in the vicinity of the intersection.

FIGURE 8.20: REDUCTION OF FOCUS DISTANCES (SOURCE: BIRTH, 2000)

The width of a driver’s field of view is influenced by the driving experience and the nature of the road
environment (urban or rural, Table 8.2).

Optimum angles of view are:

Vertically: 20° up and 60° down.
Horizontally: 15-20°.

A measure that can be used to improve the optical density of the field of view is to interrupt the
unobstructed overview to the horizon in long straight road sections and create fixation points that guide
drivers’ attention:

Use varying pavement types or colours.
Apply coloured signs or graphics on the pavement (Figure 8.21).
Plant diversified vegetation alongside the road.
Use reflecting markings, signs, etc.
Create artificial bottlenecks or use roundabouts.
Use fixation points along the view axis of the driver (reflecting safety barriers, signs, artwork,
etc.).
Structure the roadside with light in different colours, bness, or with several eye-catching
objects.

REQUIREMENT NO.3: THE ROAD ENVIRONMENT MUST CORRESPOND WITH THE ROAD USERS’ PERCEPTION
LOGIC

Drivers follow the road with an expectation and orientation logic formed by their experience and recent
perceptions. These affect their actual perception and reactions.

The same principle applies when climbing stairs. After only a few steps the motion balance adjusts to the
sequence of steps just perceived. In most cases, this is a subconscious process. However, if one step is of
a different height, the motion balance will become considerably disordered - possibly resulting in a
stumble or fall. Adjustment of driving programme on the road is similarly subconscious.

The perception of the lane, the edge of the lane and the lane periphery produces a general sensual
impression. Drivers react to these road elements with their actions, in the same way as the person
climbing stairs reacts intuitively to the height, depth and width of the steps. Unexpected objects disturb

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 54/353



the automatic sequence of operations, possibly causing the driver to ‘stumble’. After several critical
seconds the disturbance can be handled. Therefore, planners and designers try to keep road
characteristics flowing in a logical sequence. They should introduce inevitable changes as early and clearly
as possible and exclude any sudden changes that would confuse the driver.

FIGURE 8.22: CONTINUOUS AND DISCONTINUOUS CURVES IN A ROAD (SOURCE:FGSV, 2006)



When choosing their speed, drivers rely on their previous and recent sensory impressions of the last driven
5-10 minutes. Breaking the consistency and the experienced logic of the design causes operational
mistakes which can lead to driving mistakes and road crashes.

This particularly applies to five situations:

a) Change of road function without corresponding change in design and optical characteristics (e.g. town
entrance)

Drivers need to adapt their driving programme when entering a built-up urban area or when road functions
change significantly. They need to decrease speed and be more attentive as more decisions and reactions
are required. Generally, there should be offered unambiguous visual clues to recognize the change of
function, for instance by a horizontal swing of road’s course, optical sight barriers, planted central islands,
special speed-reducing markings or a combination of these instructions. A clear guiding Gestalt has to
instruct the driver on how to adapt the driving programme.

FIGURE 8.24: EXAMPLES – GOOD TRANSITIONS BETWEEN RURAL AND URBAN ENVIRONMENT



b) Change of road’s direction is contrary to eye-catching objects in another direction (e.g. city by-pass
dilemma)

Drivers need eye-catching objects to realize that there is a change in road's direction despite other
dominant eye-catching orientation structures or objects. The change of direction has to be supported by
covering the wrong view axis or optical misguiding.

It has been found at high risk locations that dominant eye-catching objects such as a line of trees,
buildings or straight road sections impede the correct anticipation of a road’s course even though correct
signing is present. Road characteristics that mislead spatial perception cause technically ‘unexplainable’
crashes.

FIGURE 8.25: CHANGED DIRECTION CONTRARY TO THE OLD, DOMINANT EYE-CATCHING VIEW AXIS CAN BE
CORRECTED BY A PLANTED EMBANKMENT (BIRTH ET AL., 2006)



c) Requirement for a new driving program recognised and changes are introduced to ‘re-programme’
driving habits and expectations.

Changing the -of-way or altering the course of the road - such as a new alignment will challenge driver’s
habits and expectations. Appropriate and timely signals or visual clues are required to inform the driver
and provide an adequate time for correct anticipation. The required reaction could be significantly different
from the habitual one! In order to avoid surprises, various design principles need to be considered.

It has been found at high-risk locations that newly built intersections that are not introduced properly lead
to incorrect anticipation of the situation and therefore to crashes even though correct signing is present.

FIGURE 8.26: EXAMPLE TO RE-PROGRAMME A DRIVING HABIT BY A COMBINATION OF DESIGN AND OPTICAL
GUIDANCE MEASURES (BIRTH ET AL., 2006)



d) Driver's attention and ability to process information is limited

Driver’s attention and ability to process information is limited. Driving requires multiple tasks, such as
control of lane tracking, anticipation and orientation as well as navigation. Drivers can focus on one piece
of information at a time and multiple distractions, or critical locations may result in an overload.

Too many decisions in too short time can overload the capacity for information processing and result in
safety risks.

FIGURE 8.27: THREE CRITICAL LOCATIONS: MAINTENANCE POINT, STARTING A CURVE AND EXIT ROAD
WITHOUT TRANSITION AND/OR PROGRESSIVE INFORMATION (150 M AHEAD) (SOURCE: BIRTH ET AL., 2006)



e) Deficiencies in traffic control devices

Due to higher traffic volumes, roads need to be equipped with traffic control devices for safety. Along with
rules, traffic control devices organise the driving reactions of road users. Under all light conditions and
within all optical backgrounds, traffic signs should be visible, legible and detectable. They should never be
covered by plantings or other structures. That is because the effect of mimesis may make even b,
oversized signs invisible to the driver. Mimesis, also mimicry is the ability of organisms to adapt their
coats/skin completely to their background so that they can't be detected.

Traffic control devices need to be placed to clearly indicate necessary action. Failures in placement and
changing messaging can create failures in selection and ultimately lead to emergency manoeuvres taking
place leading to a higher potential for crashes. The following images provide an example of such failure.
First of signs shown in indicate city centre and Seattle in the same direction and lane.

The second set of signs shown in Figure 8.33 are located 600 feet after the first signs and provide a
different message. The second set of signs provide no mention of City Centre or Beaverton, placing
additional workload demands on drivers and additional processing time. Furthermore, the bridge obstructs
the view of upcoming interchanges and horizontal curvature, and the location lacks symmetry and the
offset visual opening may lead the driver to the .

The final set of signs (Figure 8.34) are inconsistent with the previous messages. Additional processing time
is required to decipher messages. Visibility is challenging because of the rise in vertical grade in
combination with horizontal curvature and the road splitting to the and . All these elements require
additional steering input and processing time. The set up to the curve may be problematic because of
confusion. The complexity may lead to sudden braking and steering due to late actions being taken.

FIGURE 8.34: DEFICIENCY IN TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES EXAMPLE: THIRD SET OF DIRECTIONAL SIGNS
(PHOTO BY JOHN CAMPBELL)



The previous example highlights the potential for human error when expectations are violated. In the
following we discuss other important human factors element to consider in reducing workload demands for
drivers.

Expectations are used to help the driver prepare themselves to respond to future driving tasks, which in
turn improves driver behaviours. Predictability allows for a lessening of cognitive efforts needed to process
information. In a sense, the driver is programmed to a set of behaviours that are processed quickly and
efficiently. While we often think of expectations of drivers, setting and providing for clear expectations is
beneficial to those walking and cycling equally as it is towards the driver.

Expectations are created through design and operational consistency. Consistency allows for prediction by

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 61/353



the road users, and it provides coded rules and relationships within the road environment (e.g., through
common stop signs, or geometry, lane markings being the same or very similar), all of which lead to
improved road user response.

Expectations can be enhanced by well-designed traffic control devices based on the following principles of
primacy, spreading, coding and redundancy are discussed.

Principle of Primacy - Determine the placement of signs based on the importance of information, and by
placing the information where it is most useful and beneficial.

Principle of Spreading - Road users need time to process information. Therefore, all the information
cannot be placed very closely or together. Signage needs to be placed in a manner that provides
information in smaller processible parts to reduce information overload.

Principle of Coding - Communication through multiple means is beneficial. At stop signs, one will often
see stop bars, or additional pavement markings requiring a stop. In some systems, audible signals provide
redundant information on the moment of crossing, in addition to the simple pedestrian or bicycle crossing
signal.

The case study from Portugal, shows the use of low-cost engineering measures and law enforcement to
change driver behaviours.

CASE STUDY – Portugal: Perceptual treatment - Low-Cost Engineering Measures on a
dangerous trunk road

The case study describes the approach used in 1998 by the Circulation and Safety Division of the
Portuguese Road Administration (JAE) to improve road safety on the interchanges of a single
carriageway, two lane, trunk road that connected the Portuguese coastal area and Spain (route IP 5).
In a first phase, Low Cost Engineering Measures (LCEM) were applied, to improve the road
characteristics; in a second step, exceptionally intense and severe law enforcement actions were
employed by the police, to improve driver behaviour. Read more.

COMMUNICATION WITH ROAD USERS

Messages relating to regulatory requirements, warnings of hazards, directions, and other useful
information can be conveyed to drivers and other road users by a number of means. These include:

Signs – static or changeable electronic signs, using words, pictograms or diagrams showing
directions.
Signals – at intersections, pedestrian crossings, and railway level crossings, and which cater for
particular vehicle types e.g. buses, bicycles, emergency vehicles.
Road markings – these are a highly intuitive way of conveying messages, such as the path to
follow, areas to keep off, and points at which to stop.
Delineation – guide posts and retroreflective pavement markers have an important role to play
in providing guidance in poor weather or at night. Pavement markers generally supplement the

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 62/353



information provided by line marking.

The PIARC HFPSP guide discussed in Introduction includes actions to improve delineation or signage as
possible remedial treatments for all of the three key requirements mentioned above, usually as a
corrective measure to bring about a satisfactory resolution of the issue, or as a warning to indicate a
potentially hazardous situation. Human factors considerations are critical in the design and provision of
these treatments. The principal characteristics to be considered are:

Conspicuity – is the sign easily noticed?
Size and position of devices in relation to the required decisions or actions – e.g. Is the traffic
control device sufficiently in advance of the required decision or driving action to allow the
decision to be made or the driving action executed in an unhurried manner? These issues have
to be considered at each site, initially by the road design team, and subsequently by the road
manager during the road’s operational life.
Visibility – e.g. Does the design of the sign allow it to be easily read? Are signs or line markings
faded or worn away so much that they are no longer effective? Are they still reflective at night?
Checking and inspection to ensure visibility is a matter for the road manager. While physical
measurements are the most reliable guide to the condition of traffic control devices, a well-
managed programme of regular inspections by experienced personnel who are trained to make
consistent assessments can be an acceptable basis for managing the condition of traffic control
devices.
Comprehensibility – e.g. Can the signs (especially symbol signs) be readily understood by road
users? The design of nearly all signs is specified in the standards or guidelines of individual
jurisdictions; some of these designs comply with worldwide practice, some have proved
effective over a long period of time, and newer signs may have been subject to rigorous testing
before they were included in the standard. Difficulties can arise when new signs are required to
cover unusual situations and the proposed signs are not adequately tested on road users.
Credibility – e.g. Are the messages they convey believable? This depends very much on how
they are used in the local context. Overuse of signs can lead to them being widely disregarded.
Consistency in the use of line marking, delineation and signing over lengths of road is essential
in establishing the credibility of the system.

Note that a Safe System is not created solely by communication with road users. However, clear
indications of the expected driving actions, especially speed choice and clear warning of hazards, can do
much to reduce the number of collisions and to mitigate the severity of those that do occur. Therefore,
signing that matches user's needs human factors make important contributions to achieving a Safe
System. It will have a critical contribution to crash reduction on road systems that fall short of Safe System
requirements.

The case study from Slovenia highlights the use of human factors in road design.

used to learn (find potential defectiveness and find improvements), for further “best practice”
implementations on Slovenian roads and background for legislative part (1st pillar) and potential
guidance on how to deal with that kind of problem (linear settlements and schools alongside roads).

SPEED MANAGEMENT
HOW SPEED MANAGEMENT WORKS FROM THE POINT OF HUMAN FACTORS

Speed has a significant effect on safety – it influences crash severity and reduces the anticipation and
response time available for a given sight distance. The correlation between crash severity and speed
follows from the laws of physics. At higher speeds, the kinetic energy released in a crash increase with the
square of the speed and the changes of speed experienced by those struck by or occupying the vehicles
involved increase with speed. Small changes in speed have a significant effect on energy. So, it is not
surprising that increased speed is considered as the biggest problem in road safety. In a lot of cases,
inappropriate speed can be attributed to driver’s spatial perception on the road environment. As explained
in the PIARC HFPSP the chosen speed depends on the interaction of human information processing and
decision making on one hand and features of the road and its environment on the other hand. Modern
science shows that the choice of speed, as well as the choice of position on the road, is mostly a
subconscious process.

Most of the variables of the Human-Road Interface relate to physiological and neuronal mechanisms and
affect the speed subconsciously. The following variables influence drivers speed and fatigue and therefore
can also be used for an effective speed and fatigue management:

1. The optical density of the field of view is a function of the number of objects that contrast with the
background. A very small number of contrasting objects leads to monotony and both reduced
performance and reactivity. To avoid monotony, the driver subconsciously changes his driving
behaviour in order to increase information input: he swerves, brakes or – in most cases – increases
speed. Consequently, it is desirable to achieve an optimal level of optical density to support the
correct choice of speed and to avoid fatigue (Herberg et al., 1994).

2. Also, the curvature of the road influences speed. A sinuous swinging alignment leads to an increase
in attentiveness and a decrease of speed (Richter et al., 1998). This can be explained by the
increase of workload to steer the vehicle and an increase in information from the balance organs
that react to the change of position and curve acceleration. So, this feature also prevents the driver
of fatigue that arises from a straight, monotonous road course.

3. Research also suggests that there is an optimal road width from a speed environment perspective.
Drivers increase speed on very wide roads (>8,00m) and also on narrow roads (<7,50m). In
addition, reaction times are best on roads within this range. (Zwielich et al., 2001). This is possible
because the activation of driver’s neuronal system has an optimum in this case and prevents him
from task determined fatigue.

4. It is proofed that the visible amount of road’s surface influences speed. It is a function of both
dimensions: width and length of the road surface. The more of the surface that is visible – such as
long straight sections or wide roads – the faster the driver will drive (Klebelsberg, 1963; Cohen et al.,
1997). In combination with all other findings above it suggests realising a curvy design instead of a

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 64/353



design with long straight sections and stretched curves. It allows also the conclusion that a broader
road should have a higher curvature than a narrow road.

5. If the driver failed to identify a critical location that requires decreasing speed like a change of
road’s function, a crossing, or other demands, they will drive with inappropriate speed. So maybe
they were not able to perceive the need to slow down. In summary, missing references from road
and the road surrounding, optical illusions, misperceptions of curves, exits, crossings or other
situations can be also cause for the inappropriate speed. This can be easily corrected with Human
Factors design practice as described in PIARC HFPSP.

The following case studies from France, Italy, Singapore and Sweden all highlight different techniques and
reasons for speed management.

The highway A10 connects Paris and Bordeaux. During the holyday migrations, many usual traffic
jams appeared in 2 areas: north of Orleans before the bifurcation of highways A10 and A71; and

CASE STUDY - Sweden: Bicycle passages and bicycle crossings

The project studies the consequence of a change in traffic law. On the 1st of September 2014, traffic
law changed in Sweden. The change meant, among other things, that the concept of bicycle crossing
was introduced and defined, with rules for the yield towards cyclists who are on or just traveling on a
bicycle crossing, a new roads sign and requirements for local traffic regulations. In addition, it was
stipulated that the traffic environment should be designed so it is not possible to drive vehicles at
speeds higher than 30km/h. Read more

TRAFFIC CALMING

Traffic calming is the general term given to engineering techniques for encouraging lower speeds and now
includes a variety of well-documented treatments. The Institute of Transportation Engineers has a website
that provides a comprehensive overview of traffic calming measures. Fact sheets are available for some of
the most widely used types of devices, i.e.:

Devices that rely on vertical displacement – humps, flat-top platforms (speed tables), and
raised platforms at intersections.
Devices that rely on lateral displacement – chicanes and mini-roundabouts (neighbourhood
traffic circles).
Devices that rely on road narrowing – choke points and central islands.
Street closures.

The website also has links to areas dealing with other types of treatments such as kerb extensions, refuge
islands, raised crosswalks and rumble strips; and links to topics such as speed reduction, crash frequency
reduction, and reductions in cut-through traffic movements.

From the Human Factor point of view, they trigger the fixation in the nearer field of view and guide the
attention to the places, or they break the straight road axis and with this also the straight view axis that
increases speed. In case of road narrowing the measures increase the difficulty of driver’s task to hold the
balance on a narrower road. That’s why they have not only a physical, but first an optical stopping effect.

Traffic calming principles have been widely applied in the establishment of low-speed zones in residential
areas. This concept originally emerged in the Netherlands as the ‘woonerf’ or ‘living zone’; it has since
been adopted in several countries under various forms. The key success factors are that the road network
must carry low traffic volumes, the completed scheme must not be able to be traversed quickly, and the
appearance of the streets should be changed.

Findings from 40 different cities across Europe, including Brussels, Paris, and Zurich, showed that
reductions in speed limits significantly enhanced road safety by reducing both the risk of crashes and the
severity of those that occurred. On average, implementing 30 km/h speed limits in these European cities
resulted in a 23% decrease in road crashes, a 37% reduction in fatalities, and a 38% drop in injuries.
(Yannis & Michelaraki, 2024).

Combinations of treatments such as pavement markings, road narrowing, and signage have been used
effectively to reduce the speeds through settlements. A report from the UK Department for Transport
provides a comprehensive summary of research on traffic calming (Department for Transport, 2007),

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 66/353



including gateway treatments (Figure 8.35). Low-level gateway treatments were found to reduce speeds
by less than 5 km/h; more substantial treatments by up to 11 km/h; and the most substantial treatments,
which involved narrowing of the carriageway, by up to 16 km/h.

Makwasha and Turner (2013) found speed reductions associated with gateway treatments in New Zealand.
Consistent with previous research, they found that speed reductions were greater at pinch point gateways
where the roadway had been narrowed compared to gateways that consisted of signage alone. Consistent
with speed reduction data, there was a 41% reduction in fatal and serious injuries at pinch point gateways,
but small increases in crashes at the ‘sign only’ gateways. This agrees closely with earlier work by Taylor
and Wheeler (2000) in the UK, which found a 43% reduction in fatal and serious injury crashes for gateway
treatments alone, but reductions of 70% in these crashes when accompanied by downstream traffic
calming treatments.

SPEED FEEDBACK SIGN (SOURCE: DR PETER CAIRNEY)



A detailed hypothetical example of how a gateway treatment might be provided is discussed in the PIARC
HFPSP guide. Gateways are also used at the entry to lower-speed zones within urban areas. However, as
speeds are generally low at these points anyway, their effectiveness can be hard to evaluate (Department
for Transport, 2007). The case study from Germany shows an example of bundling the motorized vehicles
to help organize traffic flow.

junction. Brandenburg an der Havel is a city with about 71.000 inhabitants in the region Brandenburg
in north-east Germany. The Nicolaiplatz is a triangular square with an important function for the local
traffic, located in the city centre, nearby the historic city of Brandenburg an der Havel. The sums of
the traffic volumes of all access roads to Nicolaiplatz are approximately:15.000 vehicles, 450 city
busses, 360 trams, 500 cyclists (estimated) per 24 hours. Before the redesign, the function and
geometry of Nicolaiplatz was significantly influenced by the traffic facilities before the remodelling
(see picture 1). The Bus- and Tram stops were spread over the entire square and the whole traffic
infrastructure was disordered and unclear for both, motor vehicle traffic and local public transport.
Furthermore, all facilities were outdated and not in a good condition. Read more

THE ROLE OF ROAD HIERARCHIES AND SELF-EXPLAINING ROADS
As mentioned in previous sections, road and traffic engineers have an effective array of techniques and
devices available to provide information to the road user. If the basic road design creates a road
environment and Gestalt that give consistent impressions on how to drive on that type of road, the speed
choice will be appropriate. This concept is generally referred to as a ‘road hierarchy’.

‘Self-explaining roads’ require a holistic approach in designing the road system and its immediate
surroundings to make the required driving actions obvious to the driver. The European Commission
website describes self-explaining roads in the following terms:

‘The aim is that different classes of roads should be distinctive, and within in each class,
features such as width of carriageway, road markings, signing, and use of street lighting
would be consistent throughout the route. Drivers would perceive the type of road and
‘instinctively’ know how to behave. The environment effectively provides a ‘label’ for the
particular type of road and there would thus be less need for separate traffic control devices
such as additional traffic signs to regulate traffic behaviour.’

Roads have different functions which require different traffic speeds and other driving actions, e.g.
readiness to deal with cyclists and pedestrians (including young children). If these functions can be made
explicit by the design and features of the road, it should be much easier to pre-programme the drivers to
behave appropriately. A road that is truly self-explaining would make other aspects of driving demand
obvious, such as which traffic stream should give way to another, when the driver is approaching an
intersection or a curve, where pedestrians are likely to cross the road, and where the driver should position
the vehicle to make a turn across a traffic stream. A self-explaining road would require few signs or line
markings as the required driving actions would be conveyed intuitively by the appearance of the road.

In the Netherlands, where the concept originated, four categories of road seem to be sufficient to cater for
all needs (Theeuwes & Godthelp, 1995); these are:

motorways,
major inter-city roads,
rural roads to connect residential areas to shopping and services,
and woonerfs (or traffic-calmed residential zones).

Other countries may find that they need more categories to cover their full range of road types (e.g. rural
access roads, urban collector roads). The important point is that roads can be designed to create different

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 68/353



expectations about how road users should act on them.

A recent application of self-explaining roads principles in a suburb of Auckland, New Zealand demonstrates
how appropriate design – in this case retrofitting an area with planting and other low-cost measures – can
pre-programme the driving actions. After implementation, average speeds were lower on local streets but
unchanged on collector roads. In both cases, the variability of speeds was reduced after implementation
(Charlton et al., 2010). On local roads, vehicle numbers were reduced, vehicle lane keeping was less
consistent, and signalling was less frequent. Also, pedestrian numbers increased, and pedestrians were
less constrained in their movement patterns; however, these changes were not evident on the collector
roads (Mackie et al., 2013). The authors interpreted these changes as indicating that a more relaxed,
informal environment had been created on the local streets, consistent with the objectives of the project.
These changed driving actions were accompanied by a 30% drop in crashes and an 86% reduction in crash
costs.

Under a Safe System, road authorities must look to establish a clear road hierarchy that effectively
manages the potential conflicts between different road users. Ideally, each road should be defined as
having either a function that facilitates high traffic flow or one that manages exchange between different
road users, but not both. This then enables a (long term) planning and design framework that supports
good neighbourhood planning, safe road layouts, and safe speeds to ensure road users are sufficiently
physically protected.

Creating a clear functional hierarchy in the road network is an important planning tool and helps to define
movement versus place priorities as well as appropriate Safe System infrastructure responses. Roads with
a movement or flow function can accommodate higher volume, higher speed traffic but require separated
facilities along the corridors if pedestrians and cyclists are present and intersections should be treated with
roundabouts or traffic signals with raised safety platforms to manage speeds at crossing points. In areas or
on roads where different road users mix, traffic calming measures such as lane narrowing, chicanes, speed
humps, raised crossings, and landscaping are needed to create a lower speed environment. This includes
establishment of large traffic-calmed areas where through traffic is kept out, or where vehicles use is
discouraged except when people need to be inside this region.

The Movement and Place Framework is increasingly used to guide transport planning in delivering a more
integrated transport system to improve customer outcomes and support a range of user groups. Work is
already underway in some jurisdictions to integrate Safe System principles and treatments within the
Movement and Place Framework to safely cater for all road users and enable more proactive and lasting
road safety benefits. This is particularly important for the liveability of places and vibrant streets, where
greater numbers of pedestrians and cyclists gather. They are inherently more vulnerable in crashes and, in
some environments, highly exposed to the risk of crashes.

Austroads (2020) outline specific safety infrastructure measures for pedestrians and cyclists aligned to
Safe System principles within a Movement and Place Framework.

The implications of self-explaining roads are especially profound for LMICs. The evidence is that drivers
pick up powerful messages about the appropriate way to drive from the cues in the environment.
Developments affecting parts of the road system that have customarily been used for social or commercial
purposes should therefore be handled with particular care. If it is possible to retain the social or
commercial function, then care should be taken to separate through traffic movements from the mixed
activity area and ensure that a high-speed environment is not imposed on it. If it is not possible to retain
the social and commercial functions, then a suitable alternative site for these activities should be found,
and the new road facility which replaces the former mixed activity area and should be clearly identifiable

as primarily a traffic facility, to improve driver behaviour.

CASE STUDY - Hungary: Road Design of ‘Rapid Way’ Narrow Cross Section

The government's road transport development strategy mandates the construction of 2x2 lane roads,
which present a more cost-effective alternative to motorways, as defined by Hungarian standards. To
address specific parameters and requirements, a new design guide was implemented in 2016,
introducing the 'rapid way' road category. This category is intended for roadways with traffic volumes
below 10,000 vehicles/day, but in practice, it is primarily applied to roads with volumes ranging from
5,000 to 8,000 vehicles/day. Read more

Uncontrolled access and unplanned communities can also create uncertainty and potential hazards for all
road users. The report ‘Land use and Safety: an introduction to understanding how land use decisions
impact safety of the transportation system ’ (PIARC, 2016c) discusses how land use (e.g. density, use, mix)
and typical transportation factors (functional classification, context classification, transit availability, speed
and access control/management) can affect safety outcomes. The report provides examples of where and
how land use and transportation decisions are made and explores several tools and techniques to improve
safety in transportation and land use interactions.

ROAD-BASED FATIGUE COUNTERMEASURES
Addressing road-based fatigue is a key component of increasing road safety. Fatigue is well known to
reduce and keep drivers from reacting to hazards. The outcome of this is the potential to increase crashes.

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 70/353



In 2016 PIARC produced the report ‘The Role of Road Engineering in Combatting Driver Distraction and
Fatigue Road Safety Risks ’ (PIARC, 2016a). This important document highlights the problem with fatigue
and distraction and outlines road safety countermeasure to combat this ongoing issue.

There is a clear distinction between fatigue, which occurs with time spent on a task, and drowsiness, which
varies according to the time of day and how much sleep a person has had. The terms are often used
interchangeably as they often occur together and have similar debilitating effects on driving. A review for
the UK Department for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (Jackson et al., 2011) concluded that
fatigue affects driving skills in three ways:

It increases the frequency of errors (e.g. the number of times a driver intrudes on a
neighbouring lane).
It increases the size of errors (e.g. the distance that a driver intrudes on a neighbouring lane).
It increases the variability of errors (e.g. reduction in the amount of time a driver drives in the
centre of the lane).
It increases driver’s tendency for subconscious speeding to get ensure a normal activity level of
the central nervous system although the workload decreases because of monotony of the
driving task

The most effective ways of managing fatigue for professional drivers appear to be through workplace
fatigue management programmes, supported by programmes to ensure that drivers come to work well-
rested by addressing lifestyle issues. In-vehicle fatigue monitoring systems that analyse driver behaviour
and warning signs to determine the onset of fatigue have the potential to be a highly effective tool for
detecting the early stages of fatigue in drivers and minimise the likelihood of incidents. But for common
drivers in general the road design has to ensure that the basic Human Factors principles of managing
speed are realised in road design.

Roberts and Turner (2008) identified specific areas where infrastructure-based countermeasures might be
effective. These include:

REST AREAS

Opportunities to rest are likely to be beneficial. It is well-established that short periods of sleep can restore
the performance of fatigued drivers. However, there is uncertainty about the location of these facilities in
relation to high-risk sections of road, and about the best type of facilities to be provided at different
locations.

MONOTONY REDUCTION TREATMENTS

Monotony reduction was thought to be worthwhile, but there was uncertainty about what type of
monotony reduction would be effective because there is a lack of empirical and experimental data until
yet. But it is well known that long straight roads without sufficient curvature are creating monotony-based
fatigue to drivers. Note that the PIARC HFPSP guide suggests the creation of ‘sinuous, rhythmic road
alignments’ (i.e. gently winding roads) to counter monotony by providing a constantly changing visual field
and an activation of the equilibrioception, especially the proprioceptive system. It also suggests that the
number of bness and colour contrasts in the lateral periphery of the field of view should be increased as
also the fixation point should be limited in the nearer depth of the field of view. This can be achieved by
changed height and kind of vegetation, special markings, coloured pavements, changes of contrasts in the
vertical scenery of buildings, in tunnels and similar optical countermeasures against monotony.

SIGNAGE AND ROAD MARKINGS

Signs and road markings increase the number of bness and colour contrasts and are supportive against
road triggered fatigue. They can also draw driver's attention to areas of high risk of fatigue crashes and
advising of opportunities to rest at towns or rest areas were thought to have potential.

AUDIBLE LINE MARKINGS OR LONGITUDINAL RUMBLE STRIPS

Audible line markings are raised thermoplastic lines which create a whirring sound when driven over,
alerting the driver that the vehicle is drifting onto the shoulder (when applied as an edge line) or across
the centre of the road into the opposing lane (when applied as a centre line). These have proved to be
highly effective in reducing crashes, but generally do not generate a sufficiently loud signal to be effective
for trucks. Also, they are to be avoided near schools, hospitals and residential areas. In countries where
there is widespread use of asphalt construction on rural roads, an equivalent treatment can be produced
at lower cost by creating depressions in the asphalt by means of a special roller, or by milling grooves in
the road surface. This is not possible when the road is of sprayed seal construction , which is typical of
many roads in LMICs and HICs with low population densities. Depressions are also to be avoided on roads
on which ice frequently form. Audible line markings can also be applied to concrete roads, either by the
application of thermoplastic markings or by milling grooves in the road surface.

Reaction time depends upon the nature of the message. Drivers react faster to audible signals than to
visual signals (Table 8.3).

They also react faster to a combination of audible and visual signs than to a single signal.

Rumble strips have been shown to be very effective in warning drivers that they are leaving the traffic
lane. According to the iRAP Road Safety Toolkit, the Potential Casualty Reduction for rumble strips is
estimated to be 10-25%.

CLEAR ZONES AND BARRIERS

If these other measures fail to prevent a fatigue-related collision, then clear zones have the potential to
avoid serious injury. The clear zone must ideally be guaranteed everywhere. Where is not possible to have
a clear zone due to an obstacle (trees, poles, signposts, etc), installing a safety barrier to protect drivers
from hitting a fixed object is recommended.

KNOWING WHAT BEHAVIOURS ARE REQUIRED IN A PARTICULAR SITUATION

Even when road users have a good understanding of the road rules and traffic control devices, there may
be situations or locations where they are unsure about the correct driving procedures. These situations
generally arise in unfamiliar situations, e.g. when a site has unusual geometry, or where drivers find
themselves sharing the road with unfamiliar things such as slow, oversize vehicles, or herds of animals
being driven along the road. Ideally, a road user’s training and experience would have taught them to
behave safely and wait until any unclear/unusual situation is resolved so that they can move or overtake
safely. Over time, it would be hoped that situations with unusual or misleading geometry would be
eliminated by the progressive treatment of hazardous locations as determined by crash records or risk
analysis. In the meantime, care should be taken to ensure that correct guidance is given to all road users
by means of signage, lighting, line marking and delineation. It is important to ensure that the package of
guidance measures is properly understood, particularly if unfamiliar.

8.3 OTHER MEANS OF ENCOURAGING ROAD
USERS TO BEHAVE ACCORDING TO THE RULES
ROAD USER NON-COMPLIANCE
In addressing non-compliance with rules, it is important to consider the specifics of each situation. There
are many possible reasons why road users do not comply with the rules, and more than one of them may
be relevant in any particular situation. These different reasons require different strategies to encourage
greater compliance.

UNDERSTANDING REQUIRED BEHAVIOURS

It is possible that some road users may not understand what is required of them or what the appropriate
behaviour is in certain situations. In some cases, this may even be the majority of drivers. This is
particularly likely to be true of socially disadvantaged groups in the community, especially where literacy
is an issue. It is also likely to be true of new situations; the case of the introduction of roundabouts in
Australia and North America is a good example.

Depending on the situation, this can be remedied by actions such as:

locally-based education campaigns to reduce problems at particular locations;
jurisdiction-wide advertising and publicity to address system-wide issues.

KNOWING WHAT BEHAVIOURS ARE REQUIRED IN A PARTICULAR SITUATION

Even when road users have a good understanding of the road rules and traffic control devices, there may
be situations or locations where they are unsure about the correct driving procedures. These situations
generally arise in unfamiliar situations, e.g. when a site has unusual geometry, or where drivers find
themselves sharing the road with unfamiliar things such as slow, oversize vehicles, or herds of animals
being driven along the road. Ideally, a road user’s training and experience would have taught them to
behave safely and wait until any unclear/unusual situation is resolved so that they can move or overtake
safely. Over time, it would be hoped that situations with unusual or misleading geometry would be
eliminated by the progressive treatment of hazardous locations as determined by crash records or risk
analysis. In the meantime, care should be taken to ensure that correct guidance is given to all road users
by means of signage, lighting, line marking and delineation. It is important to ensure that the package of
guidance measures is properly understood, particularly if unfamiliar signs are part of the treatment.

CREDIBILITY OF RULES AND PROCEDURES

Rules and procedures are unlikely to be followed if they do not appear to be credible to road users, e.g.
pedestrian reluctance to comply with ‘do not walk’ signals at crossings during periods of low traffic flow, or
reluctance of drivers to comply with roadwork speed limit signs when it is obvious that no roadwork is in
progress. The risk is that road users may continue to act in this way when hazards are in fact present, so
that pedestrians cross unexpectedly in front of motor vehicles at night, or drivers continue to drive above
the limit when roadworks have recommenced. While it is difficult to apply countermeasures in the first
situation, close attention to the management of the worksite (e.g. by covering up the speed limit signs at
the end of the day’s work) goes a long way to help in the second situation.

CUSTOMARY USES OF ROAD SPACE FOR OTHER THAN TRANSPORT

Many communities use the road space for purposes other than transport and in ways which conflict with
road safety goals. In LMICs, roadside commerce is entrenched and is an important element in the
economy. Street play has been a customary use of road space in many UK cities. Reducing speed limits in
selected local areas in the UK to 20 mph (32 km/h), in conjunction with supporting traffic calming
measures, has been very effective in reducing child pedestrian casualties. An early evaluation of these
schemes indicated a 60% reduction in all injury crashes, and a 67% reduction in child injury crashes crash
injuries (Webster & Mackie, 1996).

Street vendors can contribute to both vehicular and pedestrian congestion, which may lead to traffic
crashes, higher levels of vehicle-generated air pollution, and disruptions in the movement of police, fire,
ambulance, and other emergency vehicles. Crowded sidewalks, vendors operating in the roadway, and
pedestrians forced onto the street can obstruct motorists' sightlines at intersections, while the lively
activity of street vendors can distract drivers, increasing the risk of crashes (Bromley, 2000).

Creative solutions are called for in accommodating roadside commerce and increasing traffic flows in
LMICs.

SOCIAL NORMS AND PEER PRESSURE

Apart from the official system of rules and regulations, the road safety culture of a community has a strong
bearing on how road users behave and the resulting road safety outcomes. For example, peer pressure is
an important mechanism for maintaining social norms or in some cases, engaging in behaviour that
deviates from the norm.

AGE-RELATED CHANGES THROUGHOUT A PERSON’S LIFE-SPAN

The psychological and physical changes that people experience throughout their life-span have a profound
influence on their ability to cope with the road system. If roads are to cater for the whole of the
community, road designers and managers should have an awareness of the more salient age-related

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 75/353



changes. Some of the main points are:

Young children lack the cognitive abilities to interact with motor traffic. This is compounded by
their small stature, making it difficult for them to see and be seen.
Learner drivers are very safe while they are under supervision, but have a very high crash rate
as soon as they begin solo driving. Swedish work shows that extending the period of supervised
practice before going solo reduced crashes in the first year of solo driving by 46% (Gregersen et
al., 2003).
As drivers grow older, physical and cognitive abilities may begin to decline. Older drivers can be
supported to keep driving safely by means of adaptive aids and restrictions on driving, and by
bigger and ber signs and markings. Older pedestrians may benefit from treatments such as
extended crossing times at pedestrian signals, ber lighting, and improving surface evenness on
footpaths.

SHORT-TERM IMPAIRMENT – INATTENTIVENESS, FATIGUE, ALCOHOL AND DRUGS

Short-term impairment can have disastrous effects on driving. Amongst the most frequent causes of
impairment are:

distraction;
drowsiness;
alcohol-affected driving;
alcohol-affected pedestrians;
drugs.

COPING WITH DISABILITY

Some forms of disability make it difficult for individuals to fully comply with road rules. Safe System
principles require that drivers and riders be capable and proficient; and many jurisdictions have basic
physical requirements which must be met before licences to drive or ride a motor vehicle are issued. The
most widespread issue is eyesight, and elementary screening to ensure adequate visual acuity (clarity) at
a specified distance is a usual part of the testing procedure. Few conditions prevent people from driving
altogether, as many people with disabilities, even serious disabilities, are able to drive satisfactorily with
the assistance of driving aids that help them overcome the limitations imposed by their disability. No such
screening processes apply to pedestrians or cyclists. Many developed countries have anti-discrimination
legislation that requires transport providers to ensure that disabilities do not impede access. On the road
network, some treatments that are provided to meet these requirements are:

audible signals at signalised pedestrian crossings;
distinctive patterns on the footpath surface that can be felt by a mobility cane or through the
sole of the foot;
ramps or lifts to accommodate wheelchair users, including ramps at pedestrian crossing points
set into the kerb.

ACHIEVING BETTER COMPLIANCE
Achieving better compliance with legal requirements and established driving procedures can be
considered under the four broad headings below. Each section concludes with a brief consideration of how
the infrastructure can be used or adapted to support the activity discussed in the section.

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 76/353



EDUCATION

Road safety education is generally considered to relate to programmes delivered in school.

The European Commission project ROSE-25 (Road Safety Education in all 25 EU Member States) (EC, 2005)
involved workshops and consultations throughout the EC membership, culminating in a booklet which
summarises the essential elements of good practice in road safety education. It focuses on face-to-face
interactions with school age children. The key emphasis of road safety education should be on:

promotion of knowledge and understanding of traffic rules and situations;
improvement of skills through training and experience;
strengthening and/or changing attitudes towards risk awareness, personal safety and the safety
of other road users;
following the ten key steps to the successful implementation of road safety education that are
outlined in the document (EC, 2005).

Although training and education should prepare drivers to ‘expect the unexpected’, there is a limit to
which this can be achieved, and it is clearly not possible to train drivers to deal with unexpected situations.
The best solution is therefore to minimise the number of non-standard situations through progressive
improvements to the network, and apply self-explaining roads principles as widely as possible, and thus
ensure that the PIARC Human Factor Guideline’s three rules are followed in all situations.

DRIVER AND RIDER TRAINING AND TESTING

Driver and motorcycle rider training refers specifically to the process of preparing people for their ‘careers’
as drivers or riders. This entails not only mastering basic car control skills and a working knowledge of road
rules and procedures, but the all-important skill of ‘reading the road’ and anticipating the actions of other
road users. The abovementioned work of Gregersen et al. (2003) showed that the more supervised driving
practice a learner driver had, the safer they were after they began to drive solo. Many jurisdictions have
introduced, or are about to introduce, requirements for extended supervised driving practice before taking
a practical driving test.

A review of road safety measures in the European Union countries recommended reinforcing formal driver
training by encouraging accompanied driving, and making advice and information available to the
accompanying drivers to help them maximise their effectiveness (EC, 2007). Good practice in driver and
rider testing involves test drives or rides over nominated routes, which include all or most of the critical
situations that the licensing authority deems are necessary to demonstrate competence, and that are
assessed as being approximately equal in terms of their difficulty for test candidates. Licensing authorities
should consult with road managers when identifying test routes to ensure that they choose appropriate
routes that do not cause undue interference with other traffic or expose candidates or testing officers to
avoidable risk.

ENCOURAGEMENT

Road authorities engage in publicity campaigns for a variety of reasons. The PIARC publication Best
Practices for Road Safety Campaigns (PIARC, 2012a) provides an overview of this area, based on a
literature review linked to a survey of selected PIARC members. The key messages relating to the delivery
of campaigns are:

Behaviour change is a long-term commitment.

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 77/353



Integration of publicity campaigns with other activities, such as enforcement, adds to
effectiveness.
It is important to clearly identify the audience and tailor the message to address the dynamics
of the particular behaviour in question.
Choosing the correct medium to reach the target audience is essential; with age being the most
important factor determining media habits.
Fear appeals need to be used with caution as they may be dismissed when they do not accord
with personal experience.
Evaluation is essential and should be considered as an integral part of the campaign plan.

Roadside advertising space should be available for the display of safety messages, either by having some
roadside advertising space reserved for this purpose or through the purchase of space at commercial
rates. Where available, consideration should be given to the limited use of variable message signs to
display safety messages that are appropriate to the time and place, e.g. displaying drink driving reminders
in the early evening on weekends when many drivers and riders are heading out for the evening.

ENFORCEMENT

A good general source on enforcement appears to be the European Transport Safety Council’s (ETSC )
publication ‘Traffic Law Enforcement across the EU: Tackling the Three Main Killers on Europe’s Roads’
(ETSC , 2011). This is a compendium of best practice, based on member countries’ experience. A
comprehensive set of recommendations is provided for tackling each of the three main killers – speeding,
drink driving and non-use of seatbelts – as well as general guidance on planning, target setting, and
general principles of effective enforcement.

Much progress has been made with automated enforcement in recent years, in particular with speed
enforcement. Significant changes in behaviour have occurred where automatic enforcement has been
vigorously applied. Where necessary, space should be created to allow enforcement operations to be
conducted where they are likely to have a major deterrent effect. The raised lay-bys provided on UK
motorways for speed enforcement are a good example. Positioning of speed cameras or other automated
devices needs to be carefully considered to coordinate with other infrastructure where possible (e.g.
positioning point to point speed cameras on existing gantries).

8.4 ENSURING APPLICATION IN PRACTICE
Human Factors issues are not as well catered for as they should be on most of the world’s roads, including
those in HICs. A number of major in-depth crash investigations were carried out in the 1960s and 1970s
that implied that driving actions carried out by the road user as the main contributing factor in most
crashes. More recently, it has come to be understood that many of these driving mistakes were as much
due to deficiencies in the road system as to failings on the part of the driver. These included crashes due
to inadequate sight distance, poor lighting at critical points, poor transition zones, insufficient
management of the field of view as well as misguiding drivers expectations and road surfaces that
provided less friction than the driver was expecting.

HICs may therefore have a large backlog of road deficiencies to rectify to ensure that Human Factors and
needs of users are adequately integrated in their design standards and the practice to treat high risk
locations across their networks. The same is likely to be true for LMICs. However, the road system cannot
be brought up to standard unless the basic design tools – the road design standards and guidelines – take
account of these issues. The PIARC study (PIARC, 2012b; PIARC, 2016c) suggests that there is a long way
to go before this can be achieved.

The driver demands associated with navigating a curve can serve as an example of how analysing driver
tasks can be helpful in understanding how road design impacts driver performance. Figure 8.21 describes
the activities that driver would typically perform while navigating a single horizontal curve (National
Academies, 2012). From this example, tasks like maintaining speed and lane position while entering and
following the curve are more demanding and challenging and the driver needs to pay closer attention to
basic vehicle control and visual information acquisition. Task analysis identifies the key information and
vehicle control elements in different parts of the curve driving task.

Figure 8.21 illustrates how and when driver demands are influenced by design aspects such as design
consistency, degree of curvature, and lane width. In particular, identifying highly demanding (or high
workload) components of the curve driving task provide an indication of where drivers might benefit from
information regarding delineation or benefit from the elimination of potential visual distractions.

FIGURE 8.39: EXAMPLE OF DRIVER DEMANDS WHEN NAVIGATING A HORIZONTAL CURVE (NATIONAL
ACADEMIES, 2012)



An expert Human Factors group examined the design standards from nine HICs and LMICs from across the
world and systematically compared the advice and procedures in each standard with the specific Human
Factors requirements which arise from the three Human Factors requirements described in the PIARC
HFPSP guide (see Chapter 8.2 - Designing Infrastructure to Encourage Safe Behaviour ). Requirement No.1,
giving the driver sufficient time to react, was best catered for, with the specific driver needs being fully
discussed in 49% of cases. Requirement No. 2, ensuring the road provides a safe field of view, was least
well catered for, the specific needs being fully discussed in only 9% of cases. Requirement No. 3, that the
road matches the road users’ expectations, was fully discussed in 34% of cases.

It therefore appears that much work remains to be done to bring the world’s design standards up to a level
where Human Factors issues are fully addressed and to bring the thinking of designers along with them. In
lieu of design standards that embed Safe System principles. Road Safety Audits provide a valuable means
of evaluating the safety performance of road designs with consideration of Human Factors issues. Case
studies from Canada and Iran present Road Safety Audits.

8.5 PATHWAY TO EFFECTIVE DESIGN FOR ROAD
USER CHARACTERISTICS AND COMPLIANCE

GETTING STARTED
Establish design standards and guidelines that incorporate established knowledge of
Human Factors.
Where design standards already exist, review standards to ensure that current
understanding of Human Factors is fully integrated with the needs of transition and
reaction time, the management of the field of view and a reliable pre-programming of
driver's expectations.

9. INFRASTRUCTURE SAFETY MANAGEMENT:
POLICIES, STANDARDS, GUIDELINES AND TOOLS

KEY MESSAGES
Improvements to infrastructure can contribute substantially to reductions in death and
serious injury. Many high severity crash types can be eliminated with the effective use of
infrastructure. This includes crashes that are thought to be caused by human error and
non-compliance.
Few infrastructure investments produce such high benefits as infrastructure measures
targeted at making road safety improvement.
Road infrastructure is often the single most significant factor that contributes to the
severity outcome of a crash.
Clear and defined policies relating to the delivery of Safe System infrastructure are
required to drive road safety improvements.
Good examples of infrastructure policy can be found. Benchmarking against good practice
should be undertaken to identify required changes in policy. Care should be taken when
borrowing policy from other countries to ensure that it is fit for local conditions. However,
there are a number of universal approaches that are applicable.
Standards, guidelines and tools are a mechanism to translate policy into action. Without
linking to policy, such documents and tools can be reactive, and delivery of safe
infrastructure can lack structure and direction.
Guidelines to assist in the implementation of infrastructure policy exist. These can be used
to assist in the delivery of Safe System infrastructure, although they will need to be
adapted for local conditions. Such guidelines require constant review and update based on
good practice.
The occurrence of key crash types on high risk routes can be reduced through effective
infrastructure treatments. For those just starting to address safety, corridor demonstration
projects are a very effective way to improve safety.
A number of tools are available to help implement safe infrastructure. An overview of tools
is provided in this chapter, while details can be found in Chapter 10. Assessing Potential
Risks and Identifying Issues and Chapter 12. Monitoring, Analysis and Evaluation of Road
Safety

9.1 INTRODUCTION
Chapter 3. The Road Safety Management System provided information on the broader management of
road safety, while Chapter 6. Road Safety Targets, Investment Strategies Plans and Projects highlighted
the need for effective road safety targets, policies and plans at the national and jurisdictional level. This
chapter moves the focus to the importance of policies, standards, guidelines and tools relating to road
safety infrastructure. The planning, design, operation and use of the road network will only produce
effective results when interventions (including safe infrastructure programmes and projects) are
implemented as part of an effective management system. An evidence-based approach is required that
links institutional management functions to interventions, which in turn produce desired results. Details of
this road safety management process are provided in Chapter 3. The Road Safety Management System.

Information is provided on the development of policies, standards and guidelines, as well as tools to assist
in delivering safe infrastructure. The introduction provides general principles of infrastructure safety
management, drawing on material presented in earlier chapters (see especially Chapter 3. The Road
Safety Management System and Chapter 6. Road Safety Targets, Investment Strategies Plans and
Projects). It also sets a framework for later chapters by providing the overall approach to the assessment
and treatment of road infrastructure for effective road safety outcomes. This approach involves the
assessment of risk (identifying high risk locations discussed in detail in Chapter 10. Assessing Potential
Risks and Identifying Issues), identifying the issues contributing to these crashes (also in Chapter 10.
Assessing Potential Risks and Identifying Issues) identifying and selecting appropriate solutions (Chapter
11. Intervention Selection and Prioritisation), prioritising action (also in Chapter 11. Intervention Selection
and Prioritisation) and monitoring, analysis and evaluation (Chapter 12. Monitoring, Analysis and
Evaluation of Road Safety). This overall process is graphically represented in Figure 9.1:

HOW DO I GET STARTED?
Start by assessing what infrastructure safety policies you have, and tools you already use, and assess
whether these are the best for your situation. The information in this chapter will help identify
required policies.

Train key staff to understand infrastructure safety management, and especially the principles
provided under the Safe System approach (Chapter 4. The Safe System Approach).

Collect and analyse crash data, as well as other intermediate data, starting with high risk routes (see
Chapter 5. Effective Management and Use of Safety Data).

Start to develop tools to assess risks, initially through corridor and area demonstration projects
utilising existing crash data as well as analysis of road deficiencies (see Section 9.4. Management
Tools).

Knowledge on effective interventions is required. Information on this issue is available in this manual
(Chapter 11. Intervention Selection and Prioritisation).

Staff need to be trained in the use of road safety infrastructure management tools.

9.2 GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF INFRASTRUCTURE
SAFETY MANAGEMENT
In general, it is believed that driver error contributes to a large proportion of road crashes, with some
studies suggesting that human error has played a role in over 90% of crashes (e.g. Sabey, 1980; Treat,
1980). Although the role of human error in road crashes is substantial, such figures downplay the
significant role that infrastructure can have in achieving Safe System outcomes (also see the discussion on
this issue in Chapter 4. The Safe System Approach).

When a crash occurs, road infrastructure has the most significant influence on the severity outcome
of a crash. Improvements to infrastructure can contribute substantially to reductions in death and
serious injury.

Findings from Sweden identified that road-based factors were most strongly linked to a fatal crash
outcome. Stigson et al. (2008) reviewed fatal crashes based on in-depth crash investigation, with crashes
categorised based on factors that contributed to the crash outcome (as opposed to crash causation). The
study identified that there were strong interactions between the three system components (vehicles, road
infrastructure and road user issues), but that road-based factors were most strongly linked to a fatal crash
outcome.

Further evidence of the role that infrastructure plays in fatal and serious injury crash outcomes can be
found from research that investigates the benefits of infrastructure safety treatments. Various studies
have identified that well-designed infrastructure can reduce fatal and serious injury crash outcomes by up
to 80% (examples of road safety countermeasures and their expected crash reduction impacts are outlined
by the FHWA). This reduction can occur regardless of whether crashes were the result of human error (also
see Chapter 8. Design For Road User Characteristics and Compliance). For further information on effective
treatments, see Chapter 11. Intervention Selection and Prioritisation.

There is a strong economic argument for the provision of safe infrastructure. Examples exist from many
countries that demonstrate the benefits from targeted road safety improvements. OECD (ITF, 2008)
identified that such targeted improvements can deliver up to 60 times the benefit compared to the cost
(i.e. for every $1 spent, benefits of up to $60 in terms of crash cost savings can be achieved). As identified
by the UNRSC (2010), few other infrastructure investments produce the economic benefits of
infrastructure targeted at improving road safety. Take for instance the installation of cable median barrier
to reduce cross median crashes as this has become common practice in some nations (for instance
Sweden and the United States). Even more substantial investment programmes are able to return
substantial safety benefits when compared to their costs. An analysis undertaken by iRAP (www.irap.org)
on improvements to road infrastructure on the worst 10% of roads (i.e. those roads with greatest number
of deaths and serious injuries) in each country identified substantial potential gains when comparing the
costs with the benefits. The average over all countries was a benefit-cost ratio (BCR) of 8:1 (i.e. $8 worth
of benefits for each $1 invested). This ranges from a BCR of 5:1 in high-income countries, to 19:1 in upper
middle-income countries over a 20-year period.

The European Commission, under the Horizons 2020, developed the SafetyCube project as an innovative
road safety Decision Support System (DSS). The intent of this effort was to allow policy-makers and
stakeholder the ability to select and implement the most appropriate strategies, measures and cost
effective approaches to reduce casualties of all user types and all severities in Europe and worldwide. The
United States also has the Crash Modification Factors Clearinghouse the includes over 7000 interventions
and the potential crash reduction for each countermeasure. Both of these tools provide significant
information and resources on the use of road infrastructure to reduce crash potential.

A solid understanding of key infrastructure principles is required by road agencies and others responsible
for delivering road safety. Some of the key elements of relevance to the development of infrastructure
policy, standards, guidelines and tools include:

Understanding of, and adherence to, the Safe System approach, including acknowledgement
that designers are ultimately responsible for the design, operation and use of the road system,
and therefore the entire safety of that system (UNRSC, 2010).
Safety needs to be embedded in planning and design. In order to have maximum and cost-
effective impact, safety needs to be included as early as possible. This includes ensuring that
new projects have safety embedded and that existing roads are upgraded to account for Safe
System principles.
Priority policy issues for major roads include the need for a clear distinction and separation
between inter-urban high-speed roads and urban roads (i.e. hierarchy); strong control and
management of land use and urban development; and planning cities and communities for
those without cars (i.e. walking, cycling and public transport) (UNRSC, 2010).
There is a need to identify high risk locations through the traditional approach involving
analysis of crash locations, and a proactive approach based on design elements and road and
roadside features. Combining these approaches will maximise opportunities to identify risk. The
focus when identifying high risk locations should be primarily on fatal and serious injury.
Risk locations should be addressed in a cost-effective manner. Again, the focus should be on
the elimination of fatal and serious injuries.
There is a requirement for monitoring, analysis and evaluation of the network, including safety
performance and the impact of changes that are made. This assessment of change is often
overlooked but is required to ensure expected outcomes are met.
Monitoring, analysis and evaluation allows changes to be made based on the outcome to risk
reduction throughout the system. It is important to establish a method and a strategic approach
about how to carry out evaluation of the system, and how changes to the safety system or
program will consider addressing the new knowledge gained from the evaluation.

Guidance on the risk assessment process has been developed across many different industries and
activities, including road safety. The process (briefly introduced in Figure 9.1 in Section 9.1 Introduction)
involves the identification of high risk locations, analysing data to determine the cause of this risk,
identifying evidence-based solutions that are effective in addressing the risk, implementing these
solutions, and then monitoring and evaluating the outcome. Each of these stages is explained in detail in
Chapter 10. Assessing Potential Risks and Identifying Issues to Chapter 12. Monitoring, Analysis and
Evaluation of Road Safety.

In broad risk assessment terms, the chance of sustaining death or serious injury can be decreased by
reducing the:

Exposure to the risk (an example may be diverting traffic from low quality roads to higher

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 91/353



quality ones, or shortening crossing distances for pedestrians).
Likelihood of the crash (this includes the provision of a predictable road environment), for
example by reducing conflicts between vehicles and vulnerable road users.
Severity of the crash (for example, by providing a forgiving roadside to reduce harm if a vehicle
does leave the road).

With an understanding of these factors, crashes can be influenced in a number of ways through changes in
the road environment. As examples, improvement in safety can be gained from:

Reducing exposure.
Regulating/controlling movements and turns, especially at intersections and access points.
Reducing speeds.
Reducing conflict points.
Separating vehicles of different mass (e.g. specific facilities for pedestrians and cyclists
segregated from motorised vehicles) and travelling in different directions (e.g. median barriers).
Warning road users of unusual or risky features (e.g. providing advanced warning).
Providing adequate information to enable road users to negotiate the roadway safely.
Removing hazards (e.g. utility poles and trees from the roadside).
Reducing the aggressiveness of obstacles (e.g. changing the material of rigid poles to breakable
poles).
Protecting road users from hazards that cannot be removed (e.g. providing guardrail and
median barriers).
Improving surface friction.

Engineering-based treatments generally work by influencing one or more of these factors. Examples of
such treatments and their effectiveness can be found in Section 11.2 Project-level and Network-level
Approaches.

THE ROLE OF POLICIES, STANDARS, GUIDELINES AND TOOLS
Standards, guidelines and tools are the mechanisms that support the consistent interpretation and
delivery of policies. Policies set the framework for road safety activity, and without these, delivery of road
safety is reactive and lacks structure. The policies will often set the direction at a high level and will also
contain direction on how to achieve standards using a predetermined set of criteria. Guidance on strategy
and policy development can be found in Chapter 6. Road Safety Targets, Investment Strategies Plans and
Projects and in Development of Policies, Standards and Guidelines in Section 9.3 Policies, Standards and
Guidelines.

These Policies, standards and guidelines are often slow to change, either because of lack of research,
unwillingness to change current practice or lack of knowledge related to the given system.

Changing established practice is often difficult, and careful management of this process is required. Strong
leadership is needed to facilitate policy shift, and this needs to happen in parallel with an update of
corresponding policies, standards and guidelines. Change requires understanding and awareness, the
desire to create change, the knowledge to implement the change, and the ability to do so within the
environment or system in which an individual works.

Once policies are set, there is need for linkage to standards guidelines and how the associated criteria for

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 92/353



meeting the standards can be achieved. Standards (as well as road rules and regulations) dictate those
things that must be done to achieve a predetermined level of quality or attainment. In many countries,
standards also have a legal basis that are adopted in design and operational manuals. Criteria are the
specifications for achievement of the standards and are typically detailed as policy. Guidelines provide
direction on how things should be done but are not necessarily requirements. In contrast to established
policy and standards, there is scope to deviate from the advice provided in guidelines, but this must be
justified and assessed for the impact on safety outcomes. When deviating from policies and standards,
documentation outlining the reasoning is often used. Policies and standards are typically based on many
years of experience and outcomes from research and understanding. Guidelines, because they are not
requirements, may contain reasoning for how the standards and policies were developed, how to apply
them in different circumstances, and might provide ranges of values to consider based on the conditions
encountered.

It is important to note that compliance with policy, standards and guidelines does not mean that safety will
be maximised, nor minimised when they are not achieved. There are many examples where new roads
have been built to standard but have a less than desired safety outcome. Policy, standards and guidelines
are often dated, and may not include adequate content based on Safe System principles. The manuals that
contain the policies, standards and guidelines, generally offer the minimum acceptable values for design.
Departing from the minimum requirements sometime occurs when the financial, environmental, viability,
or social cost are high and the relative change in safety risk is low. These trade-offs are often documented
to discuss reasoning for not achieving the policy, standards or guidelines.

There is much to be gained by looking to other countries for guidance on setting new policies, standards
and guidelines, and such an approach is important for benchmarking (also see Country Management
System Framework in Section 3.2 Management System Framework and Tools). However, often safety
policies, standards and guidelines are directly copied from other countries without due consideration of
local conditions, design for vulnerable road users, different vehicle types and road user compliance.

Also, in many circumstances, policies often provide fewer options for use in constrained environments. It is
typical that several compromises need to be made in road design. When combined, these issues can lead
to poor safety outcomes (also see the discussion in Global Level in Section 9.3 Policies, Standards and
Guidelines on minimum criteria, and the concept of extended design domain). Typically, an assessment of
the likely road safety impact is required to ensure that safety objectives are met. It is for this reason that
approaches such as road safety impact assessment and road safety audit (see Road Safety Impact
Assessment and Road Safety Audit in Section 10.4. Proactive Identification) are required, and that when
undertaken, these are not just a check against standards and guidelines.

Knowledge of the safety implications of design decisions is constantly improving, and with this there is
sometimes a need to update policies and procedures. This includes the need to update standards,
guidelines and tools.

Box 9.1 indicates how a policy decision that was initially driven by economic reasons at the political level
has resulted in safer road design principles on major roads in New Zealand.

BOX 9.1: NEW ZEALAND REVIEW OF DESIGN STANDARDS FOR ROADS OF NATIONAL SIGNIFICANCE

New Zealand has recently implemented a policy to improve the safety standard on Roads of National
Significance (RoNS). The initial motivation for this policy was as part of an economic stimulus package,

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 93/353



and investment through this programme was focused on the movement of freight and people more
efficiently and safely, particularly around the main population centres. Currently, there are seven RoNS,
each of which are key state highway links. As part of the national safety strategy, each of the RoNS will
need to attain at least a four-star safety rating under KiwiRAP (the New Zealand risk assessment
programme). A review of design standards was undertaken to ensure that this safety rating is reached.
Key design elements to change to ensure this safety outcome are: the use of centre-of-road wire rope
barrier, and roadside barrier systems. These treatments are aimed at targeting run-off-road and head-
on crashes, two of the key severe crash types on New Zealand roads.

LINKAGE WITH OTHER POLICIES, STANDARDS AND GUIDELINES
Delivery of road safety infrastructure does not occur in isolation, and it is important to consider broader
safety, road management and societal issues when developing policies, standards and guidelines.

Similarly, it is important to advocate for road safety outcomes when developing broader transport and
related policies. The Belize case study provides a useful demonstration of linking infrastructure
improvements to other safety improvements. Land use measures have a strong linkage to safety
outcomes, an issue that is often overlooked in LMICs. Such measures define the type and intensity of the
generated traffic, and the way it enters and exits the roadway. A detailed discussion on this issue can be
found in Section 7.3. Impacts of a Safe System Adoption on Roles and Responsibilities of Authorities.

CASE STUDY - Belize: Multi-sector road safety projects

Although Belize is only a small country, it recorded 70 road traffic deaths in 2009, equivalent to 21
traffic deaths per 100,000 population. In order to address this issue, two projects were initiated. The
first involved a review of safety management capacity (see Section 2.4 the Importance of
Government Leadership) and work to reach consensus on a multi-sectoral investment strategy for
improving road safety management capacity. The second involved a Road Assessment Programme to
evaluate the safety of 370 miles (almost 600 km) of road corridors. Both tasks were completed in
January 2012, and identified several key issues and constraints affecting road safety in Belize. Read

There are also links that can be made with broader policy agendas, as illustrated by the case study from
the Netherlands.

CASE STUDY - Netherlands: Speed management, environment, safety and congestion
multi-sector road safety projects

Persistent air pollution problems in the Randstad (an agglomeration in the Western part of the
Netherlands), particularly from nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions, led the Dutch Government to

experiment with reduced speeds on motorways in this densely populated part of the country. In
2002, an 80 km/h zone was introduced on the A13, a motorway between The Hague and Rotterdam.
The speed limit was reduced from 100 km/h to 80 km/h, which was strictly enforced by section
control. Read More

As a further example, asset management involves maintaining and upgrading road infrastructure, and this
typically has road safety implications. It is often the case that planning and funding for asset management
and road safety outcomes occur in isolation, and without adequate linkages between the two and this can
impact how a project is ultimately designed and constructed. Both activities are closely linked, with each
directly influencing the other. Adequate knowledge of the safety implications of asset decisions is required
when establishing policy and practice. Similarly, safety decisions can have a substantial impact on asset
management (particularly costs for maintaining assets). For instance, the installation of unnecessary
roadside crash barrier on flat slopes would increase the potential for crashes, increase maintenance and
replacement costs, and not reduce the injury potential. When installed correctly the crash barrier systems
can be used to shield other assets from impacts, close gaps in locations where injury potential is high and
protect workers who may need to maintain the assets.

When considered in isolation, the two road management approaches are often thought to act in conflict.
There may be a perception that increases in funding for road safety may mean less funding or increased
expenditure for asset management. However, there is some clear evidence that the two can act in
harmony to produce benefits that are greater than those that can be delivered when considered in
isolation.

Specific examples from LMICs are scarce, but the example in Box 9.2 from Australia serves to illustrate the
level of benefits that can be gained through a coordinated approach. Combining the safety benefits with
those from asset improvements can often lead to better project viability. This issue is discussed further in
Chapter 7. Roles, Responsibilities, Policy Development and Programmes.

BOX 9.2: ASSET MANAGEMENT AND SAFETY OBJECTIVES CAN BE COMPLEMENTARY

The Asset Management Branch of the Department of Infrastructure, Energy and Resources in Tasmania
has developed a sustainable maintenance plan which is aimed primarily at preserving road pavement
assets, including extending the lives of existing roads through pavement reconstruction, strengthening
and resurfacing. Where an existing road is below departmental standards, cross-section improvements
are usually made during reconstruction. This includes increasing the carriageway width, shoulder width
and shoulder type, with sealing an option on some roads. Other elements, e.g. embankments, side
slopes and drainage improvements, will also be undertaken.

As part of the analysis that underpins the Department’s plan, a study demonstrated that where
pavement reconstruction was accompanied by cross-section improvements, in general, total crashes
were considerably reduced, with an estimated social cost saving of approximately AUD$36 million. The
corresponding marginal benefit cost ratios (MBCR) improved from 5 to 9 when these additional safety
and travel time benefits were included (i.e. society could gain $8 compared to $4 per additional $1
invested when the safety benefits were added). The significant increase in MBCR was because many of
the benefits were not being counted, i.e. the asset managers did not account for the safety and travel
time benefits of their programme, noting that 89% of the additional benefits were due to estimated

crash reductions.

Whilst this is clearly a worthwhile achievement, the potential reduction in crashes for the whole network
was identified as being up to five times greater if cross-section deficiencies were addressed
independent of pavement reconstruction. Thus, maximising benefits requires consideration of total
needs.

9.3 POLICIES, STANDARDS AND GUIDELINES
DEVELOPMENT OF POLICIES, STANDARDS AND GUIDELINES
Chapter 7. Roles, Responsibilities, Policy Development and Programmes provides direction on the
development of policies for road safety outcomes. This includes the need to understand current road
safety challenges and opportunities through the analysis of data, and the development of a road safety
plan that includes appropriate strategies, priorities, measurable targets and potential interventions. The
development of infrastructure policy follows the same process and should be considered as part of broader
road safety policy development. Safety modifications occur on projects of all types, not just safety-oriented
projects. Consideration of how safety modifications will occur with projects outside of safety program is
important.

Bliss and Breen (2009) provide advice for LMICs that are establishing road safety capacity in terms of their
investment strategies (also see Chapter 3. The Road Safety Management System), and this advice is useful
for development of policies, standards and guidelines. The advice suggests that the initial focus for such
countries should be targeted on high crash density demonstration corridors and urban areas. The value of
this demonstration corridor approach has been discussed throughout this manual, including the CASE
STUDY from Belize.

Bliss and Breen (2009) also discussed the need to review and benchmark safety policies and interventions
with other countries, and that this should lead to the commencement and implementation of reforms. This
advice is equally relevant to road agencies attempting to implement new infrastructure policies. In order to
focus attention to the highest priority areas, and to build capacity through doing, policies to address
crashes at these locations can be addressed as a priority. Similarly, awareness of successful approaches
adopted in other countries, and movement towards such approaches is a valuable method.

Little guidance exists on the mechanisms for transforming road infrastructure safety policy into relevant
standards guidelines, although Beagle et al. (2015) provide an example approach. Rather, there are a
number of examples that highlight what can be achieved. Many countries have developed their own
standards and guidelines, and in some cases, these may be adopted for use in other countries (although,
as noted elsewhere, caution should be used where the context is different). Croft et al. (2010) provide
some advice based on the development of national guidelines in Australia. Some of the key elements from
this process were produced:

Under the direction of a review panel or task force.
Based on review of existing guidelines and related technical documents.
So as to incorporate new strategic directions (e.g. the Safe System design principles).
To include relevant research results, technological developments and practitioner experience.

There is a need to constantly review standards, policies and guidelines, and to improve these based on
recent innovations. Updating these elements does not suggest that previous designs are unsafe, as
updating is done to reduce crash potential based on new scientific evidence and knowledge. An evidence-
based data driven approach is required to ensure that expected safety benefits from any changes are
attained. Benchmarking of approaches used in countries that perform well in safety is a good step to
helping identify possible innovations. Further analysis may be required to ensure that changes will have a
positive safety benefit when applied in a different country. Demonstration projects to trial new innovations
are useful to establish whether such changes are beneficial in a controlled environment. Once evaluated

and shown as successful, these can be applied more broadly, and recommended changes reflected in
appropriate guidance documents.

EXAMPLES OF INFRASTRUCTURE POLICIES, STANDARDS AND GUIDELINES
There is no set template for the development of policies, standards and guidelines, and those countries
that do have comprehensive coverage of these vary in content, often reflecting local conditions. For those
who wish to develop or improve policies, standards and guidelines it is beneficial to benchmark against
good performers and draw upon international and regional examples of good practice. The sections below
outline examples at global, regional and country levels, and may serve as a starting point in this exercise.
The case study from India is an example of how to drive policy changes in road safety.

CASE STUDY - India: Saving lives through policy and road upgrades

Each year, over 207,000 people are killed and many more seriously injured in traffic crashes in India
(WHO, 2013). Since 2010, the World Bank and the Global Road Safety Facility, along with the state
and national authorities have undertaken iRAP assessments to drive major policy, road upgrade and
public health outcomes Read more

GLOBAL LEVEL

There has been a significant shift in road safety policy in recent years in response to the Safe System
approach. This issue, including the origin of the approach and its implications, are discussed in detail in
Chapter 4. The Safe System Approach. The Decade of Action for Road Safety, described in Chapter 2. Key
Developments in Road Safety, has also resulted in some significant policy shift. At the international level,
the UN Road Safety Collaboration (UNRSC) in the Global Plan for the Decade of Action 2011-2020 included
policy guidance on safe roads and mobility (also see Section 2.2 The UN Decade of action and global plan).
The plan states that the purpose of this pillar is to:

Raise the inherent safety and protective quality of road networks for the benefit of all road users,
especially the most vulnerable (e.g. pedestrians, bicyclists and motorcyclists). This will be achieved
through the implementation of road infrastructure assessment and improved safety-conscious
planning, design, construction and operation of roads.
Source: UNRSC, 2010, p.12.

The plan suggests that this can be achieved by six key activities, namely to:

Promote road safety ownership and accountability among road authorities, road engineers and
urban planners.
Promote the needs of all road users as part of sustainable urban planning, transport demand
management, and land use management.

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 98/353



Promote safe operation, maintenance and improvement of existing road infrastructure.
Promote the development of safe new infrastructure that meets the mobility and access needs
of all users.
Encourage capacity building and knowledge transfer in safe infrastructure.
Encourage research and development in safer roads and mobility.

Details on how each of these activities might be delivered can be found in Box 9.3. Individual countries will
need to assess how they respond on each of these activities, but the information provides a useful
checklist of actions that can be undertaken to improve the management and delivery of safe roads.

BOX 9.3: PILLAR 2 OF THE GLOBAL PLAN: SAFER ROADS AND MOBILITY

Activity 1: Promote road safety ownership and accountability among road authorities, road engineers
and urban planners by:

Encouraging governments and road authorities to set a target to eliminate high risk roads.
Encouraging road authorities to commit a minimum of 10% of road budgets to dedicated
safer road infrastructure programmes.
Making road authorities legally responsible for improving road safety on their networks
through cost- effective measures and for reporting annually on the safety situation, trends
and remedial work undertaken.
Establishing a specialist in road safety or traffic unit to monitor and improve the safety of the
road network.
Promoting the Safe System approach and the role of self-explaining and forgiving road
infrastructure.
Adhere to and/or fully implement the regional road infrastructure agreements developed
under the auspices of the United Nations regional commissions and encourage the creation
of similar regional instruments, as required.
Monitoring the safety performance of investments in road infrastructure by national road
authorities, development banks and other agencies.

Activity 2: Promoting the needs of all road users as part of sustainable urban planning, transport
demand management and land-use management by:

Planning land use to respond to the safe mobility needs of all, including travel demand
management, access needs, market requirements, geographic and demographic conditions.
Including safety impact assessments as part of all planning and development decisions.
Putting effective access and development control procedures in place to prevent unsafe
developments.

Activity 3: Promote safe operation, maintenance and improvement of existing road infrastructure by
requiring road authorities to:

Identify the number and location of deaths and injuries by road user type, and the key
infrastructure factors that influence risk for each user group.
Identify hazardous road locations or sections where excessive numbers or severity of
crashes occur and take corrective measures accordingly.

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 99/353



Conduct safety assessments of existing road infrastructure and implement proven
engineering treatments to improve safety performance.
Take a leadership role in relation to speed management and speed sensitive design and
operation of the road network.
Ensure work zone safety.

Activity 4: Promote the development of safe new infrastructure that meets the mobility and access
needs of all users by encouraging relevant authorities to:

Take into consideration all modes of transport when building new infrastructure.
Set minimum safety ratings for new designs and road investments that ensure the safety
needs of all road users are included in the specification of new projects.
Use independent road safety impact assessment and safety audit findings in the planning,
design, construction, operation and maintenance of new road projects, and ensure the audit
recommendations are implemented.

Activity 5: Encourage capacity building and knowledge transfer in safe infrastructure by:

Creating partnerships with development banks, national authorities, civil society, education
providers and the private sector to ensure safe infrastructure design principles are well
understood and applied.
Promoting road safety training and education in low-cost safety engineering, safety auditing
and road assessment.
Developing and promoting standards for safe road design and operation that recognize and
integrate with human factors and vehicle design.

Activity 6: Encourage research and development in safer roads and mobility by:

Completing and sharing research on the business case for safer road infrastructure and the
investment levels needed to meet the Decade of Action targets.
Promoting research and development into infrastructure safety improvements for road
networks in low-income and middle-income countries.
Promoting demonstration projects to evaluate safety improvement innovations, especially
for vulnerable road users.

Still at the global level, the UNRSC (2010) in their Safe Roads for Development document highlight some
priority infrastructure policies, particularly in relation to LMICs. They suggest that priority crash types be
targeted on high-risk roads. Crash types include those involving vulnerable road users walking or cycling
across or along the road, head-on crashes, side impacts at intersections, and run-off-road crashes. High
risk roads refer to the small proportion of the world’s roads where the majority of fatal and serious injury
crashes occur. They highlight that in the UK, just 10% of roads account for more than half of all road
deaths, and around a third of all serious injuries. They also mention that in Bangladesh, 3% of the arterial
road network accounts for 40% of road deaths.

The priority actions for these roads and crash types include that:

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 100/353



Cities and communities should be planned for the growing number of people who do not own a
car (i.e. vulnerable road users).
Planning and provision for vulnerable road users should include:

Land use control.
Widening and repair of footpaths.
Enforcing laws to prevent vehicles from parking on footpaths.
Removing barriers and street furniture on footpaths.
Improvements to pedestrian crossings.
Influencing land use planning alongside major roads (i.e. linear development).

Linked to this international policy context, a number of global guidelines have been produced to help
address road safety. Produced by the World Health Organisation (WHO), Global Road Safety Partnership
(GRSP), FIA Foundation and the World Bank, guidelines exist on various elements linked to road safety
infrastructure. Of greatest interest to the audience of this manual are the guidelines on data systems (as
discussed in Chapter 5. Effective Management and Use of Safety Data), and speed management and
pedestrian safety. Other global guidelines exist on helmets, seatbelts, child restraints, and drinking and
driving. All the guidelines can be downloaded from the WHO website.

REGIONAL LEVEL

Regional policy for the delivery of safe infrastructure can also be found, most notably in the EU Directive
2008/96/EC as amended by EU Directive 2019/1936 of the European Parliament and of the Council. Issued
in 2008 and amended in October 2019, this directive covers the trans-European road network, motorways
and other primary roads. Separate European guidance on the secondary road network can also be found
(see e.g. Polidori et al., 2012).

Provisions of the Directive include that:

Road safety impact assessment be carried out on all infrastructure projects on the trans-
European network, motorways and other primary roads. These are designed to assess the
impact on safety of different planning alternatives.
Road safety audit be conducted on all infrastructure projects. Such audits should be conducted
at the draft design, detailed design, pre-opening and early operation stages.
Network-wide road safety assessments be undertaken in order to assess crash and impact
severity risk based on a mixed approach that considers the in-built characteristics of the road
and a crash analysis.
Periodic road safety inspections be undertaken regularly.
Data systems be put in place to collect information on fatal crashes and calculate the average
social costs of fatal and serious injury crashes.

In 2023, the European Commission made available guidelines on methodology for network-wide road
safety assessments (European Commission, 2023). Although not mandatory, these guidelines aim to help
public authorities in EU Member States to carry out the safety assessments of their road networks as
required under the Directive.

Further details on the approaches highlighted above can be found in Chapter 10. Assessing Potential Risks
and Identifying Issues.

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 101/353



Regional approaches to road safety in LMICs have also been developed, often under the Development
Bank, UN Regional Commission, or regional economic grouping leadership.

The summary document ‘Improving Road Safety in Asia and the Pacific’ provides useful advice and
reference material on road safety based on recent ADB experience (see Katon & Bestari, 2013).

The case study in Chapter 2. Key Developments in Road Safety describes the regional approach that was
taken in the development of the African Road Safety Action Plan (2011–20). The development of this plan
involved a wide range of stakeholders. At the country level, different approaches have been taken to the
development of policy, and provision of relevant infrastructure standards and guidelines. This is often in
response to different local context, including different legislation or safety issues. As identified elsewhere
in this manual, there is typically no one correct approach to successfully managing road safety. However,
there are often general principles that are universal.

COUNTRY LEVEL

In the United States, the Highway Safety Manual (AASHTO, 2010) provides detailed guidance on the
roadway safety management process. The approach proposed is broadly aligned with that used in many
countries, and it is no coincidence that the approach mirrors the structure of Planning, Design and
Operation of this manual, particularly Chapter 10. Assessing Potential Risks and Identifying Issues to
Chapter 12. Monitoring, Analysis and Evaluation of Road Safety. The process includes keys steps, from
network screening (identifying and ranking sites) to safety effectiveness evaluation (monitoring
effectiveness).

Pre-dating the Highway Safety Manual, AASHTO produced a series of guides to assist in the delivery of the
Strategic Highway Safety Plan. This comprehensive suite of 20 guides provides direction on key strategic
issues. Those relating to road infrastructure include guides on addressing collisions with trees in hazardous
locations, head-on collisions, unsignalized and signalised intersections, run-off-road collisions, collisions on
horizontal curves, utility poles, pedestrians and work zones. These documents can be downloaded from the
Highway Safety Plan website (http://safety.transportation.org/guides.aspx).

Other countries have a similar set of guidelines to advise on effective road safety infrastructure
management. For example, the Austroads Guide to Road Safety (currently in seven parts) provides
guidance for Australia and New Zealand (Austroads, 2021b); the Netherlands have the Road Safety Manual
(CROW, 2009) and the book Advancing Sustainable Safety (Wegman & Aarts, 2006); and the UK has the
Good Practice Guide (DTLR, 2001). These documents are accompanied by many other relevant standards
and guidelines in each country. As an example, in France, Cerema has produced a number of guides and
reference documents (some of which have been translated into English). Also from France is the
‘Transportation Safety in Urban Area: Methodological guide’ (Certu, 2008; available in French and English).

Although all these documents are technically sound and serve as a useful basis for infrastructure safety
management, as identified above, care should be taken when translating these guidelines to other
countries. Different approaches, and particularly different solutions, may be more appropriate when the
context (including traffic mix) is different.

As already identified in this section, different policies or guidance are sometimes issued for roads of
different function. The EU Directive only refers to the primary European road network, while additional
information is available for lower order roads (see e.g. Polidori et al., 2012 for guidance on the secondary
road network). Although the general principles that apply to each type of road are the same, often the
detail can be different. Similarly, some countries issue guidance for local roads, recognising that the

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 102/353



constraints can be different. Examples include ‘A Road Safety Good Practice Guide’ from the UK (DFT,
2006); FHWA guidance in the United States on ‘Developing Safety Plans: A Manual for Local Rural Road
Owners’ (Ceifetz et al., 2012); and ‘Local Government Road Safety Management Guidance’ (Austroads,
2020a). McTiernan et al. (2010) also provide useful guidance on development of the Safe System approach
for local government in Australia. However, usually only one guidance document exists covering road
safety management of all roads, with those managing different parts of the network expected to adapt the
information to their own circumstances.

PIARC (2012) conducted an important review of national road safety policies and plans. This addressed
policies for infrastructure improvements, and included the following key conclusions:

A better understanding is required regarding the linkage between infrastructure and speed.
A mixture of ‘spot location’ and system-wide approaches are used in different countries (and
within countries). There is a place for both approaches, but there needs to be recognition that
the current system is generally not safe or that there are opportunities to address the potential
risk considerations.
Risk assessment processes (Road Assessment Programmes are specifically identified) are
highly beneficial, not only in identifying risk locations (including when crash data is not
adequate), but also in identifying treatments. The process is also useful to help raise awareness
about road features that contribute to risk, and how some treatments can be more effective
than others.
There is a need to conduct network-wide assessments, and prioritise action based on potential
benefits.
Comparing crash rates to an average for the network might not result in substantial safety
investments, as this approach will generally maintain the average.

This current document is obviously the key guidance document produced by PIARC on road safety
infrastructure. In addition, there are many other important documents relevant to road safety policy and
guidance that can be accessed from the PIARC website. These cover design and development of road
infrastructure, road safety audits, safety on construction zones, vulnerable road users, road operation,
road safety in winter conditions, road tunnels and others. The documents include those listed in Box 9.4.

As well as supporting the UNRSC in the development of the Global Plan, the World Bank Global Road Safety
Facility (GRSF) has produced a number of policy and guidance documents, many aimed specifically for use
in LMICs. Comprehensive resources to assist in the delivery of safe road infrastructure can be found on the
GRSF website.

ROAD DESIGN AND TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT GUIDELINES

Along with guidance documents targeted at safety-related topics (discussed in Examples of Infrastructure
Policies, Standards and Guidelines) many countries have comprehensive guidance on the design,
construction, traffic management and maintenance of roads. These typically embed safety, although it is
noticeable that many have not yet fully embedded Safe System principles. Guidelines are often slow to
include innovative approaches to road design, as these may take a number of years to construct and
evaluate. There may be infrequent updates of guidelines, and there may be reluctance to change
established practice. An evidence-based approach is required, as well as a process to facilitate continual
improvement and updates to guides.

It is not possible to include comprehensive advice in this document on issues relating to road design,
traffic management and maintenance, but rather readers are directed to appropriate country-based
guidelines for this detail. As for safety-related guidance, countries are encouraged to benchmark against
good performers (i.e. those with low crash rates) when developing or updating their own guidance.

Road design and construction involves the geometric design, and structural design of the roadway. A key
objective of geometric road design is to optimise operational safety and transport efficiency within
constraints (including budgets, environmental concerns and other social outcomes). Design needs to take
into account the traffic volume and type of traffic expected to use the road. The elements, that are
typically thought to impact on efficiency and safety, include intersections, horizontal curves, vertical
curves and gradients, cross-section (lane and shoulder width, medians and roadsides), and merge/diverge
areas, and design guides typically cover these issues in detail. Information is available on the influence of
different design elements and the impact this has on safety outcomes (e.g. AASHTO, 2010; National
Academies, 2014; Austroads, 2010).

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 105/353



The following points provide a brief description of effective countermeasures and the safety benefits of
different design elements based on the above references. For further information on intervention
effectiveness see the Crash Modification Factor Clearinghouse and the SafetyCube DSS. It is important to
note, however, that although these treatments have a known effectiveness in reducing crash risk in HICs,
it may be a different case for LMICs. For example, wider sealed shoulders may provide additional space for
drivers to recover after a driving error, but in LMICs this area may be utilised by the community to set up a
roadside stall or as a pedestrian walk space.

Design criteria include:

Design speed: The selected design speed influences the characteristics of various geometric
elements on a roadway, such as lane widths, horizontal and vertical curves, and sight distance.
The speed selected should reflect the speed drivers expect to travel at on a section of roadway,
and should take into account the abutting developments, the roadway function and its physical
limitations (due to terrain, expected traffic volumes, etc.).
Lanes and shoulders: Crash risk can be linked to the total seal width (lane and shoulder seals).
Crash risk decreases with increasing seal width (i.e. wider lanes and larger shoulders), as the
sealed area provides a recovery zone for errant vehicles and space for evasive manoeuvres. For
two-lane rural roads, shoulder sealing can reduce crash risk by up to 35%.
Horizontal alignment: This involves the design of horizontal curves along a road. Crash risk
increases with decreasing curve radius (i.e. as a turn gets tighter). The risk increases more
rapidly for curve radii below 400m. The crash risk is also higher for isolated curves (or where
the driver might not be expecting it), and lower for curves in a sequence of similar-standard
curves.
Vertical alignment: This involves the road grade (the rate of change of vertical elevation) and
vertical curves (i.e. crests and sags). Sag curves are not known to have any significant effect on
safety. The most crucial effect crests have on safety is through sight distance, which is covered
in the next bullet point. There is a small relationship between crash risk and vertical grade – the
crash risk also increases more rapidly for grades beyond 6% as vehicle speeds becomes more
difficult to manage.
Stopping sight distance: This is the distance required for a driver to recognise a need to stop
and brake to a stop from a particular speed. Horizontal and vertical curves limit a driver’s sight
distance, particularly crests. A small increase in crash risk can be assumed when the sight
distance over a crest decreases. This risk increases more rapidly for sight distances below 100
m. Road widening (either as wider shoulders or an overtaking lane) over a crest with less than
adequate sight distance can be an effective countermeasure rather than flattening the crest.
Improving limited sight distance at locations where other vehicles may be slowing or stopping
(in particular intersection sight distance) can be extremely important for safety.
Roadside clearance: Also known as horizontal clearance or lateral offset, roadside clearance is
distance between the edge of the roadway or shoulder to a vertical roadside obstruction, and
the type of obstruction a vehicle might hit. Crash risk can potentially be reduced by 35 to 45%
when all roadside hazards are removed (e.g. trees, poles, fences, etc.); however a barrier
installation can be an effective countermeasure for reducing run-off-road crashes. It should be
noted that a ‘clear’ roadside must also be flat or mildly sloping (e.g. 1:4 or flatter), and that
roadsides with steeper gradients can have a large impact on vehicle safety.

The following references provide examples of road design guidelines from different countries:

The United States has ‘A Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets’ (more commonly

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 106/353



known as ‘The Green Book’ – AASHTO, 2018) produced by the American Association of State
Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO). Many other relevant documents also exist,
including the ‘Roadside Design Guide’ (AASHTO, 2011). These documents are available from the
online AASHTO store.
The United Kingdom has the Design Manual for Roads and Bridges (DMRB).
Australia and New Zealand have the Austroads Guide to Road Design (comprising 7 parts).
Towards Safer Roads in Developing Countries, produced by TRL in the UK provides very useful
information on designing for safety, and is targeted at those in LMICs (TRL, 1991)
In South Africa SANRAL has produced the Geometric Design Guide.
The World Bank in association with the Dutch Ministry of Transport, Public Works and Water
Management have produced ‘Sustainable Safe Road Design: A Practical Manual’, a document
targeted at LMICs, and providing an overview of relevant safe road design aspects (DHV, 2005).
The GRSF (World Bank) produced the ‘Guide to Integrating Road Safety into Road Design’ (Mitra
et al., 2021). The guide aids road improvement and safety feature development in LMICs, with
relevance also for HICs. It offers practical design guidance for urban and rural settings based on
global LMIC experience.

Traffic management concerns the safe and efficient movement of people and goods. This includes
provision for pedestrians, cyclists and other vulnerable road users. Again, many guidelines exist to assist in
management of roads and traffic, and these typically relate closely to design principles, the capabilities of
road users, and to vehicle characteristics. Guidelines typically cover aspects such as traffic theory, traffic
studies and analysis, and the use of traffic control devices (signs, line markings) and other associated
measures (traffic signal operation and street lighting). They may also cover issues such as speed
management and traffic calming, public transport facilities, parking and management at roadworks.

Example guidelines include:

In the United States there is the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (known as the
MUTCD) (FHWA, 2023).
Ireland has the Traffic Management Guidelines (DoT, 2019).
Australia has produced the Austroads Guide to Traffic Management, covering 13 parts.

Typically design guidelines are prepared with an underlying assumption that they will be used where there
are minimal constraints in delivering the project. These are sometimes referred to as ‘greenfields’ sites
and the Normal Design Domain (NDD) design criteria should be used. However, it is far more common to
make safety or other improvements at locations where constraints do exist, such as upgrades to existing
roads, or ‘brownfields’ sites. Constraints can include things like an existing road alignment, utilities
(including poles), drainage, access points, etc. In these situations, applying NDD values can make projects
financially unviable. In addition, there may be cultural, heritage or environmental issues that limit
application of NDD standards.

Many jurisdictions have developed procedures for dealing with departures from the NDD. When deviating
from recommended design criteria, an exception report is required. This should be produced early in the
design stage, and it should include clear and careful consideration of the safety impacts of any departure,
as well as the impact on traffic operations. Mitigating strategies to minimise any adverse risk from the
exception should also be provided.

Guidance on safety impacts resulting from departures in the NDD can be found in several countries, along

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 107/353



with information on mitigation strategies. Useful examples include guidance by the New Jersey
Department of Transportation (2012) and Stein and Nueman (2007). Guidelines for road design on
brownfields sites can also be found on the Austroads Guide to Road Design, Parts 1, 3 and 4A (Austroads,
2021a).

One recent approach from the United States (but also applied in other locations using different names) is
the concept of ‘Performance-Based Practical Design’ (PBPD), which has evolved from the ‘practical design’
approach (see WASDOT, 2017 and MoDOT, 2024). This involves designing projects to stay within identified
needs and removing non- essential elements. This has the effect of lowering costs and enabling
improvements at a greater number of locations. The move to a ‘performance-based’ approach means that
informed decisions will be made using analysis tools (for example, the Highway Safety Manual (AASHTO,
2010) and FHWA - data driven safety analysis).

Agencies using PBPD would have specific, long- and short-term, performance goals that may apply to a
project, a whole corridor, or the overall system. Using available performance-analysis tools and qualitative
assessments, projects would only include those features that serve those long- and short-term
performance goals. Projects would not need to include features that provide performance exceeding the
stated goals, fail to serve those performance goals, or are inconsistent with the purpose and need. This
removes a concern relating to Practical Design that agencies may overemphasize short-term cost savings
without a clear understanding of how such decisions would impact other objectives (such as safety and
operational performance, context sensitivity, life-cycle costs, long-range corridor goals, liveability, and
sustainability).

PBPD is a philosophy of balancing project purpose and need, design standards, life-cycle costs, operational
and safety performance and sustainability. To gain the greatest benefit from PBPD, it is highly encouraged
to take a system-wide perspective and incorporate PBPD concepts in all decisions related to planning,
programming and project development. Starting at the planning and programming phase, a multi-
disciplinary group can weigh the options and trade-offs to define performance goals and a focused project
purpose and need that is used throughout the life of the project. The case study from the Czech Republic
discusses self-explaining road performance.

CASE STUDY - Czech Republic: The self-explaining performance of Czech roads

A variety of countermeasures has been proposed and continuously applied in the Czech Republic,
such as infrastructural improvements, increase of police enforcement, and improvement of traffic
safety education. Despite the efforts, annual evaluations of the National Road Safety Strategy
fulfilment show that the goals have not been met. In this critical situation, new solutions and
measures need to be adopted. An option, mentioned in the Strategy, is to improve the road network
based on the principles of self-explaining and forgiving roads. Self-explaining environment is such
traffic environment which simply elicits safe behaviour by its design – the concept involves designing
a road system in which the drivers’ expectations created by the road environment are implicitly in
line with safe behaviour. Read more

9.4 MANAGEMENT TOOLS
A variety of tools and approaches are available to assist in the delivery of infrastructure safety
management. As with guidelines, some tools have been prepared for use at the global, regional or country
level. In some cases, the tools developed in one location or country can be adapted for use in another, but
extreme care needs to be taken to ensure that the new context is considered when doing this. The types
of tools available for road safety infrastructure management are mentioned in brief here, with further
details provided in other relevant sections of this manual.

Schermers et al. (2011) provides a useful summary of tools used in Europe (most of which are discussed in
this document. Elvik (2011) suggests a framework for applying tools that are related to the stages of a
road’s life cycle. In the USA, AASHTO has also developed a comprehensive suite of tools for road safety
infrastructure management. These are briefly discussed in the example in Box 9.5.

BOX 9.5: AASHTOWARE SAFETY, USA

AASHTOWare Safety is a software platform specifically designed to support transportation agencies in
the area of highway traffic safety management.

As defined by the Highway Safety Manual, there are six steps in the Roadway Highway Safety
Management Process: 1) Network Screening, 2) Diagnosis, 3) Countermeasure Selection, 4) Economic
Appraisal, 5) Project Prioritization, and 6) Safety Effectiveness Evaluation. By facilitating the data
unification and manipulation process, the AASHTOWare Safety platform provides automated insights
that allow agencies to make decisions with a higher degree of confidence.

The platform includes different tools:

Crash Query Tool, to manage crash data.
Network Screening Tool, to identify sites with potential for safety improvements through
algorithms that identify areas of concern (e.g. higher than expected crash frequencies).
Safety Analysis Tool, to perform crash diagnosis by segment and automatically calculate
the benefit-cost ratio of a countermeasure.
Predictive Analysis Tool, to understand expected crash rates.

Further details on these tools can be found here.

Tools such as those in Box 9.5 follow the broad stages of infrastructure safety management identified in
Section 9.1 Introduction. Later chapters discuss each of the key tools. The tools referenced for different
stages of road safety management include:

Assessment of potential risk: A variety of tools exist to assist in the collection and analysis of
crash and non-crash road safety data to assist in this task.

Crash data: Section 5.3. Establishing and Maintaining Crash Data Systems. discusses
the establishment and use of crash data systems, and some of the useful tools that
are desirable for such systems.

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 109/353



Non-crash data: Section 5.4 Non-Crash Data and Recording Systems. discusses non-
crash data, including the need for systems to collect and analyse such information.

Identifying issues: Traditionally, tools for the assessment of risk have been reactive, as they
were based on a concentration of crashes over time. In recent years, more proactive tools have
been developed to identify risk locations. Both reactive and proactive tools are required to
provide a full assessment of risk. Tools and approaches include:

crash-based identification (Section 10.3. Crash-Based Identification (‘Reactive
Approaches’))
road safety impact assessment (Road Safety Impact Assessment Section 10.4.
Proactive Identification)
road safety audit (Road Safety Audit in Section 10.4. Proactive Identification)
road safety inspection (Road Safety Inspection in Section 10.4. Proactive
Identification)
road assessment programmes (Road Assessment for Safety Infrastructure in Section
10.4. Proactive Identification).

Intervention selection: A variety of tools are available Section 10.4. Proactive Identification to
help in the selection of appropriate interventions to address road safety risk. These include
various websites that provide information on possible treatments based on problems identified.
Chapter 11. Intervention Selection and Prioritisation discusses some of the tools that can be
used to assist in the selection of these treatments.
Prioritisation: Prioritisation tools exist to help conduct economic appraisals of different options
at a location, or for different locations, and then to prioritise projects to help achieve the
greatest benefits based on available budgets. This prioritisation process, as well as some of the
tools that are available, are discussed in Section 11.4. Priority Ranking Methods and Economic
Assessments.
Monitoring, analysis and evaluation: Monitoring, analysis and evaluation is an essential part of
infrastructure safety management. A limited number of tools are available to assist in this task,
including the Countermeasure Evaluation Tool as part of the Safety Analyst suite discussed
above. Further details on the importance of monitoring and evaluation can be found in Chapter
12. Monitoring, Analysis and Evaluation of Road Safety.

A further example from France can be seen in Box 9.6.

BOX 9.6: ROAD SAFETY APPROACHES FOR INFRASTRUCTURE, NATIONAL ROAD NETWORK, FRANCE

Since the early 2000s, France has developed and implemented a set of road safety approaches for
infrastructure projects. This set of approaches is now outlined in the European Directive 2008/96/EC
(amended by Directive 2019/1936) on road safety infrastructure management for French
implementation projects.

A Road Safety Impact Assessment is carried out for all infrastructure projects at the initial planning
stage before the infrastructure project is approved. It identifies the road safety considerations which
contribute to the selection of the proposed solution and provides all relevant information necessary for
a cost-benefit analysis of the different options assessed.

A Road Safety Audit of the design characteristics from a safety viewpoint is carried out for all
infrastructure projects by a trained auditor or a team of auditors. Audits form an integral part of the

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 110/353



design process of the infrastructure project and are carried out at different stages of the project: draft
and detailed design, pre-opening and early operation. Where unsafe features are identified in the
course of the audit, the design is rectified. When it is not rectified before the end of the appropriate
stage, the reasons are stated by the authority in an annex of the report.

A Road Safety Inspection is carried out on the national road network for all existing roads in order to
report on the details of the road, its surrounding area and the general environment that can influence
the user’s behaviour or affect their passive safety and thus have repercussions on road safety. The
concept is to provide a method that will help the operator to improve their network knowledge.

Inspection visits are made by appropriately qualified personnel, to identify the main road safety issues,
and to provide a fresh point of view on the system. The systematic inspection of a section of road thus
consists of a quick and practical rating of the main configurations that may not be expected by the road
user, considering all modes of transport.

Source: Sétra, 2008

Safety of users on existing roads: this approach, called SURE (Sécurité des Usagers sur les Routes
Existantes) in France, is carried out on the national road network for all existing roads. It is a general
method of which the main innovation is to explicitly and continuously provide a complete approach of
road safety improvements, from the road safety issues study to the assessment stage via the
implementation of treatments. The aim of this approach is to determine and implement adapted
treatments for sections of road where the safety gain is potentially higher.

The SURE process is a practical application of the common road safety approach presented in Examples
of Infrastructure Policies, Standards and Guidelines in Section 9.3 Policies, Standards and Guidelines:

Know: an issues study is conducted on a network divided into sections of road in order to
establish a hierarchy of these sections compared to the potential safety gains.
Understand: a safety diagnosis and a set of treatments’ concepts are established for each
selected section.
Take action: among those treatments’ concepts, a number of treatments are chosen and the
road operator undertakes the planning, development and realisation of those treatments.
Assess: the treatments’ assessment and the monitoring of crashes on the selected road
section and its zone of influence are realised.

Sources: Sétra, 2006a, 2006b, 2006c

All of these tools can (and should) be used in parallel. Each is useful for different purposes, and for
different stages of infrastructure safety management. Strengths and weaknesses are discussed in later
chapters. Historically, the collection and analysis of crash data has been the most widely applied approach
to managing safety. This is likely to continue to be an important approach and is an important starting
point for those in LMICs. Road safety audit and safety inspection are other widely applied tools, including in
LMICs. One added advantage of these approaches is that they are a useful mechanism to improve safety
culture.

One often over-looked issue is that the earlier within the safety management process, or project
development process, the greater the potential to make a cost-effective improvement in safety outcomes.
This is best demonstrated in the planning and development phase. In many countries, road safety
practitioners have historically relied upon road safety audit to determine safety issues in planning and
development stages of design. In more recent times, tools to assist in embedding safety into design at the
earliest stages have been developed. Importantly, some of these are aimed at practitioners who are not
from a safety background in an attempt to include safety considerations into decision-making. These tools
can be either quantitative in approach (such as tools that are based on crash prediction models) or
qualitative.

One of the most widely applied quantitative models is the US Interactive Highway Safety Design Model
(IHSDM). This includes several modules, some of which can be used at the project development stage
(AASHTO, 2025). It should be noted that this tool is generally applied to existing roads in the US, as very
few new roads are built. Further information on IHSDM can be found in United States' case study below
and in Section 10.4. Proactive Identification.

iRAP has also been used to quantify safety implications at the early design stage. The following four case
studies explore the use of management tools in efforts to improve road safety for Malaysia, India, Moldova
using iRAP.

CASE STUDY - Malaysia: Black spot program: Before and after ratings

An important part of the Malaysian Government’s response to the growing road safety problem is its
hazardous locations/black spot program, which aims to improve high risk sections of road with
affordable low-cost infrastructure treatments. Read more

CASE STUDY - India: Star rating designs for Karnataka

In 2010, a number of high-risk corridors were identified across the state of Karnataka and identified
for upgrade with the support of the Global Road Safety Facility (GRSF) to help prevent road deaths
and serious injuries on the Indian road network. As part of the project the Karnataka State Highway
Improvement Project (KSHIP) was established, and potential road user risk was assessed (Star
Ratings) on 550 km of road selected for rehabilitation in the Indian state of Karnataka. Jebatan Kerja
Raya (JKR), the Public Works Department in Malaysia, worked with iRAP to undertake Star Rating
assessments to estimate the change in road safety risk as a result of infrastructure improvements
undertaken at several high-risk sites and hazardous locations in Malaysia by comparing the before
and after risk scores. Read more

CASE STUDY - India and Moldova: Assessment and improvement of design plans

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 112/353



New road designs are still being produced that result in significant numbers of deaths and serious
injuries. The iRAP star rating has been used in a number of countries to help improve design in order
to achieve better safety outcomes. Examples include a pilot project in Moldova (the M2-R7 corridor –
116 km) and in India on the Karnataka State Highway Improvement Project (550 km). The projects
were supported by the Millennium Challenge Corporation and the Global Road Safety Facility,
respectively, as well as local and international partners. Information was drawn from the road design
plans prior to construction or rehabilitation to rate the safety of the proposed design. Read more

CASE STUDY - United States: Interactive Highway Safety Design Model (IHSDM)

Idaho Transportation Department (ITD) identified deficiencies on Idaho State Highway 8 related to
traffic operations, road geometry, access control and safety. Idaho State Highway 8 is an 18 km two-
lane highway traversing through rural residential and agricultural land uses. ITD wanted to conduct a
corridor study to assess the existing traffic conditions, geometry, and to predict future crashes. ITD
used the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) IHSDM software for this study. The IHSDM software
is a package of analysis tools to evaluate the safety and operation of geometric design decisions on
highways, and predict crashes based on the AASHTO Highway Safety Manual methodologies. Read
more

The Strategic Tool for Assessment of Road Safety (STARS), developed in Australia, relies on
checklists to help identify negative safety outcomes (Jurewicz, 2009). This approach provides a risk value
to each of the checklist questions, and ultimately an overall safety rating for the planned project.
Checklists are available for different stages of development, including regional or structure plans, master
plans, sub-division or neighbourhood plans, arterial corridors, and new/commercial developments.
Example road safety planning issues at the regional level include:

Maximising public transport usage and minimising personal vehicle use - entails assessing ease
of access to public transport through checking the location of activity centres in relation to
public transport hubs (e.g. interchanges or train stations). It also involves assessing the location
of major employment destinations and mixed land use prioritised around activity centres.
Minimising traffic conflict along arterial roads - involves checking separation of arterial roads
from residential areas and strip shopping centres, assessing whether the proposed plans
support the control of vehicular access from arterial roads to adjacent lands and checking
whether there is grade separation at level crossings.
Maximising safe pedestrian and cyclist travel - involves assessing whether there are adequate
and up-to- date provisions for pedestrians and cyclists and whether on- and off-road facilities
are planned for.

Further information on safety assessment prior to a road safety audit can be found in Road Safety Impact
Assessment in Section 10.4. Proactive Identification.

Road safety management tools need constant review as good practice and new approaches emerge. Elvik
(2011) conducted such a review of European infrastructure safety management tools, and despite the

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 113/353



many years of development and experience in using such tools, a number of opportunities for
improvement were identified. Some of the key findings were that:

There is a need to evaluate the effect on safety of road safety audit, safety inspection and road
protection scoring, including the ability of these tools to identify safety solutions.
The techniques adopted in the US Safety Analyst tool (see Box 9.5) for network screening
should be used in Europe, and crash models should be used.
The Empirical Bayes approach should be used in the selection of high-risk locations (see
Identifying Crash Locations in Section 10.3. Crash-Based Identification (‘Reactive Approaches’)).

The following case study from Canada highlights the ability to evaluate bid proposals related to improving
safety performance.

CASE STUDY - Canada: Sea to Sky Highway Improvement Project Evaluation Methods

Highway 99, also referred to as the Sea to Sky Highway, is approximately 100 kilometres in length
and is located between the City of Vancouver and the community of Whistler in British Columbia
Canada. The highway, which was characterized by a narrow cross - section and curvilinear alignment,
had been known for its poor safety performance, with a collision rate and collision severity that was
significantly higher than other similar highways. The greatest value to the project was the ability to
systematically and consistently evaluate the submissions from the proponents bidding on the project.

9.5 PATHWAY TO EFFECTIVE INFRASTRUCTURE
SAFETY MANAGEMENT POLICIES, STANDARDS
AND GUIDELINES

GETTING STARTED
A good understanding of infrastructure safety principles based on Safe System is required
by key agency staff and stakeholders – from senior management through to technical
staff.
Review and internationally benchmark selected infrastructure safety policies,
interventions, and commence implementation of reforms.
Ensure safety is linked to broader transport policy, and safety is embedded within this
policy.
Assess the safety of high-volume, high-risk locations (e.g. high crash density
demonstration corridors and urban areas) and implement multi-sector improvement
programmes.
Adopt tools for the management of road safety, and train key staff in the use of such tools.

MAKING PROGRESS
Ensure all road agency staff have a good understanding of infrastructure safety principles
based on Safe System principles. All staff, from senior management through to technical
staff need this understanding, regardless of whether safety is the main focus of their role.
This includes staff responsible for national, regional and local roads.
Ensure that other stakeholders have good knowledge of infrastructure safety principles
based on the Safe System approach.
Implement ongoing reforms of safety policies, interventions, and introduce new measures
in accordance with international good practice.
Roll-out multi-sectoral measures (i.e. those that integrate infrastructure measures with
e.g. enforcement, education, and post-crash care improvements), including across high-
risk corridors and urban areas.
Continue to develop and tailor road safety tools and ensure road agency staff and other
stakeholders are adequately trained in the use of these tools.

CONSOLIDATING ACTIVITY
Continue to develop the understanding of infrastructure safety based on Safe System
principles amongst all agency staff, stakeholders and members of the public.
Review and internationally benchmark safety policies and interventions, and implement
reforms.
Sustain comprehensive multi-sectoral measures across the whole road network and
extend targeting to less risky roads.
Continually improve road safety tools, and maintain high level of training and use amongst
all stakeholders.

10. ASSESSING POTENTIAL RISKS AND
IDENTIFYING ISSUES

KEY MESSAGES
Assessment of risk should be undertaken for the entire road network for which the road
agency is responsible. In many countries, a small percentage of roads account for a large
percentage of deaths and serious injuries. At programme level, the task is to identify such
routes and address these as a priority.
There are established approaches for identifying high risk crash locations – but training of
key staff is required.
For existing road networks, where data is available, reactive approaches based on crash
data assessment should be undertaken to identify high risk locations. To identify crash-
based locations good crash data covering a period of at least 3 years is required.
Proactive approaches should also be adopted – especially for major road corridors –
including impact assessment, road safety audit, safety inspection, and road assessment
programmes.
Where crash data is not available, proactive approaches must be adopted while collection
of crash data commences.
Proactive approaches should be used in combination with reactive approaches when they
are applicable. This combination of approaches provides a full assessment of road safety
risk.

10.1 INTRODUCTION
The assessment of potential risks and identification (or ‘diagnosis’) of issues are the first steps of the risk
assessment process introduced in Chapter 9. Infrastructure Safety Management: Policies, Standards,
Guidelines and Tools (Figure 10.1).

FIGURE 10.1: ASSESSING RISK AND IDENTIFYING ISSUES WITHIN THE RISK ASSESSMENT PROCESS



This chapter discusses methods for identifying high risk locations, and the ways that different sources of
data can be analysed to assess the causes of this risk.

There are two main identification approaches that can be used by road safety engineers:

The traditional approach used in the identification of risk is the analysis of historical crash data
(reactive approach). This approach is still very relevant, but other sources of information used
in the risk assessment process can lead to improvements and better results.
The proactive approach (sometimes referred to as the systemic approach) relies on the analysis
of physical and operational characteristics of existing roads or road projects to identify actual or
future safety deficiencies. This approach is particularly useful in locations where crash data may
be of poor quality and in locations where new infrastructure will be built. Proactive approaches
are being increasingly used to supplement historical crash data. Furthermore, the added value
of proactive approaches is the opportunity to improve infrastructure road safety before crashes
happen and thus before road fatalities and injuries are recorded.

The focus of this manual is on the elimination of death and serious injuries, as these are the crash types
that have the greatest societal impact. However, identification of high-risk locations involving death and
serious injury does not just involve analysis of fatal and serious injury crash data. Other sources of
information can also be used to identify likely locations where serious injury or death may occur.

The following section provides brief information on project- and programme-level approaches to risk
assessment, while Section 10.3 Crash-Based Identification (‘Reactive’ Approaches) discusses crash-based

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 121/353



methods for identifying and assessing risk and Section 10.4 Proactive Identification provides information
on the proactive approaches, including Road Safety Impact Assessment (RSIA), Road Safety Audit (RSA)
and Road Safety Inspection (RSI). Section 10.5 Combining Crash Data and Road Data brings both the
reactive and proactive approaches together to discuss an integrated approach to assessing risk.

The development of effective safety treatments requires very good knowledge of the crash types and
contributing factors and, more particularly, a good understanding of traffic, roadway and roadside features
that are associated with increases in the exposure, likelihood, and severity of crashes. Expertise and
experience, which allow the development of sound engineering judgment, are key elements in road safety
improvement (road safety is often achieved from details).

Two levels of road infrastructure improvements, with differing budgetary impacts, can be identified:

Network modernization: development of new infrastructures that are safer in design and
operation (application of recent design standards, safety audits, etc.). This requires substantial
investments.
Improvement of the existing network through safety studies conducted at hazardous sites.
Remedial measures are local in this case, such as improvement of an intersection, correction of
a horizontal curve, removal of a roadside obstacle, etc. Investment requirements are less
significant. But if they are to be fully effective, they must sometimes be supplemented or
accompanied by measures applied elsewhere on the treated road (to prevent crash migration).
This type of action is highly effective (see Section 11.4 Priority Ranking Methods and Economic
Assessment).

In summary, to be really effective, road managers should implement a logical, continuous series of tasks,
as described in the following Table 10.1.

HOW DO I GET STARTED?
Guidance documents on the assessment of risk are available and should be adopted by all countries
and embedded within core business. Training in the use of the following tools should be provided:

Treatment of high crash locations (see Section 10.3 Crash-Based Identification (‘Reactive’
Approaches).
Road safety impact assessments.
Road safety audits.
Road safety inspections
Road assessment programmes (each is described in Section 10.4 Proactive Identification).

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 123/353



As a priority, assessment should be undertaken on high risk routes and corridors (see Belize case
study in Section 10.2 Programme-Level and Project-Level Approaches), utilising crash data where
available (Section 10.3 Crash-Based Identification (‘Reactive’ Approaches), as well as information on
safety-related road elements (e.g. through safety audit and road assessment programmes – see
Section 10.4 Proactive Identification).

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 124/353



10.2 PROGRAMME-LEVEL AND PROJECT- LEVEL
APPROACHES
Road agencies typically allocate funding to improve high-risk locations, whether based on crash history or
on the potential risk. This funding may take the form of dedicated funding for high-risk locations and/or be
embedded in other operating budgets (for example, major projects or asset management). Most actions
undertaken by a road agency have a safety impact, whether they are initiated for safety reasons or not. If
consideration of safety is included in all decision-making, safety risk can be reduced, often at little or no
additional cost. The assessment of risk needs to occur at the programme and project level, and the advice
provided in this chapter is relevant to both.

The first difficulty encountered in implementing such a program is of a methodological nature. It consists in
knowing how to identify dangerous sites. Objective identification methods that may be used by road
administrations are summarized in the following diagram, extracted from Figure 10.19.

FIGURE 10.2: IDENTIFICATION METHODS



Social demand for road safety improvements can be expressed in four different ways, based on the nature
of the hazard considered:

Proven hazard (objective safety): measured objectively, based on crash statistics.
Potential hazard (objective safety): scientifically assessed by measuring crash risk in relation to
road characteristics and traffic levels.
Experienced hazard (subjective safety): expressed subjectively by users, most often with a
major deviation from proven or potential hazard.
Intolerable hazard (subjective safety): types of crashes that are considered intolerable by
society, even: e.g. crashes involving children, a vehicle crossing a freeway median.

There may be significant gaps between objective safety and subjective safety (also called ‘security’ -
Figure 10.3). For example, Hauer (1997) explains that while marked crossings are perceived by road users
as a safety improvement, they have been shown to be detrimental to safety (based on Herms, 1972).



©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 125/353



FIGURE 10.3: OBJECTIVE AND SUBJECTIVE SAFETY (BASED ON HAUER, 1997)



Treatment of proven hazards and potential hazards (objective safety) uses the following scientific, rational
methods:

Crash data collection and processing.
Objective identification methods:

based on data,
based on observations.

Treatment of experienced hazard or intolerable hazard (subjective safety) should be based on
communication and information, in order to explain to road users and residents the consequences of
actions they may have suggested. The following actions should be taken:

Provide objective figures on crashes or risk and compare them with other situations.
Explain advantages and disadvantages of solutions spontaneously suggested by users.

Various types of safety indicators may be used to detect and classify road hazards. These are discussed in
more detail under Criteria for Selecting Locations to Investigate for Treatment.

Assessment of risk should be undertaken for the entire road network for which the road agency is
responsible, based upon proven or objective hazard assessment. Such an approach would require a
network-wide assessment of risks and issues. The outcomes of such an approach would identify key crash
types, trends, geographic regions or areas, deficiency types, etc., with the outcomes of this assessment
informing programmes of work.

It is often the case that a small percentage of roads account for a large percentage of deaths and serious
injuries. At the programme-level, the task is to identify such routes and address these. For those countries
with limited resources or that lack adequate data across the whole network, such locations are the most
important to assess. These locations can form the basis of a corridor demonstration project. The content
from this and the following chapters can be used as a guide to the assessment of risk across networks or
along corridors. The examples shown in the case studies below provide information on the corridor

approach in Belize and in New South Wales, Australia.

CASE STUDY - Belize: Corridor approach to risk assessment

As identified in the Case Study in section Linkage with Other Policies, Standards and Guidelines in
Section 9.2 General Principles of Infrastructures Safety Management, although Belize is only a small
country, it recorded 70 road traffic deaths in 2009, equivalent to 21 traffic deaths per 100,000
population. A multi-sector approach was taken to assessing road safety in Belize. Part of that project
involved infrastructure improvements for a demonstration corridor. Read more

CASE STUDY - Australia: Corridor approach in New South Wales

Road safety infrastructure improvements on their own were not producing strong results in terms of
fatal and serious injury reductions. New South Wales developed road safety reviews of major roads as
a dedicated corridor approach to the analysis and selection of engineering works (and some
behaviour change programmes) to improve road safety. Road safety reviews are different from
engineering audits and high-risk location programmes. Read more

At a project level, the steps outlined in this chapter are equally relevant. They highlight how to identify risk
at more specific locations (e.g. intersections, routes or areas) and diagnose risk at these locations. Crash-
based (reactive) and more proactive approaches are relevant to both programme and project level
approaches. In each case, whether programme or project level the same steps are involved in assessing
risks and identifying casual issues. The Moldova used iRAP to assess risk, and the Czech Republic’s IDEKO
research project developed method and tools for the treatment of hazardous locations.

CASE STUDY - Moldova: Improving pedestrian safety on Moldova's M2-R7 corridor

The Republic of Moldova State Road Administration wanted to rate 116 km of the M2-R7 corridor to
understand how the road infrastructure influenced the likelihood and severity of crashes. Working
from the design plans, the corridor was Star Rated in association with EuroRAP. The Star Rating
design process provided a means of objectively measuring the impact on risk of various design
iterations, and informed new safe design outcomes. Read more

On each decision-making level a road safety management system should be established and operate.
Such systems start with identification of hazardous road locations, followed by their analysis, priority
setting, proposal and application of countermeasures, and evaluation of effectiveness. The national
research project ‘IDEKO’ was undertaken by CDV - Transport Research Centre. Its objective was to
develop methods and tools for identification and treatment of hazardous road locations. Read More

10.3 CRASH-BASED IDENTIFICATION (‘REACTIVE’
APPROACHES)
This section focuses on crash-based identification of high-risk locations, a process that is known as crash
investigation, or the treatment of ‘high-risk location’. The term ‘sites with potential for safety
improvement’ is also used, as the approach involves selecting locations that have high potential for
reductions in crashes through the introduction of targeted safety improvements. The approach relies on
crash analyses to first identify safety problems before a solution is sought. These are often called ‘reactive’
methods because a response is only initiated after crashes have occurred. A fuller account of this
approach is provided in the PIARC document Road Accident Investigation Guidelines for Road Engineers
(PIARC, 2013).

As indicated above and in Section 10.4 Proactive Identification, reliance solely on crash data can produce
situations where only a small proportion of crashes can potentially be addressed. For this reason, it is
recommended that a combination of crash data and other sources of information be used to assess and
treat risk.

Reactive approaches typically include the following steps:

FIGURE 10.4: STEPS OF THE REACTIVE APPROACH



This chapter focuses on the first two points – identification and diagnosis. Consideration will also be given
to how crash data is used and its limitations. The other steps will be covered in Chapter 11. Intervention
Selection and Prioritisation and Chapter 12. Monitoring, Analysis and Evaluation of Road Safety
Interventions. A reliable crash database is a key tool in this process of identifying and analysing crash
locations (see Hospital Data in Section 5.3 Establishing and Maintaining Crash Data Systems). Other tools
also exist, for example the Network Screening and Safety Analysis in AASHTOWare Safety (see Box 9.5 in
Section 9.4 Management Tools).

USING CRASH DATA
In order to treat the occurrence of crashes, crash data is needed to provide necessary information to road
authorities. Further information on the collection and use of crash data can be found in Chapter 5. Effective
Management and Use of Safety Data. Issues relating to the need for good quality data are also discussed
in that chapter. To ensure adequate data quality, the data should fulfil the following basic requirements
(PIARC, 2013):

Accuracy (to exactly describe the individual parameters).
Complexity (to include all features within the given system).
Availability (to be accessible to all users).
Uniformity (to apply standard definitions).

The primary data source for crash reduction initiatives, especially those undertaken by road engineers, is
typically police crash reports. This data should provide crucial information, which at a minimum should
include the crash severity and the number of each injury severity type (i.e. fatal, serious, minor, etc.).

A (non-exhaustive) list of other important information to collect includes (PIARC, 2013):

Crash identification number.
Information about the crash site (e.g. an accurate location).
The occurrence of events that resulted in the crash (e.g. the crash type).
Information on those involved (gender, age, road user type, whether alcohol was involved, use
of seatbelts, etc.).
Weather and lighting conditions.
Vehicles involved.
Time of day, day of week, and date.

Crash type is of particular importance, as it provides the basis for some crash location selection criteria (as
discussed in the following section). Normally, crash types are divided into groups of crashes with common
attributes, such as all crashes involving vehicles colliding head-on, or all crashes involving pedestrians.

FIGURE 10.5: EXAMPLE OF SINGLE VEHICLE CRASH

IDENTIFYING CRASH LOCATION
It is important to be able to identify the location where a crash occurs. A crash location can be an
individual site (such as an intersection or bend in the road), a segment of road, an area of the road
network (such as an entire corridor), or a collection of locations across the network (road system wide) that
display the same crash characteristics. In order to identify crash locations, access to a comprehensive
database is required to provide sufficient information about the exact locations and circumstances of
crashes that have occurred. Once all crash sites have been located, there needs to be selection criteria so
that only worthy sites are selected for further analysis and treatment.

The following sections provide an overview of the approaches that can be used in identifying crash
locations. Detailed guidance on the identification of high-risk locations has been developed in many
countries. In addition to the PIARC (2013) manual, further information can be gathered from many sources,
including AASHTO (2025), Austroads (2021), and RoSPA (2007). The African Development Bank (2014a)
has released guidance that is specifically intended for use in LMICs.

DEFINING LOCATIONS

High risk locations are often located at nodes of the road network, i.e. at crossing points between two or
more roads (conventional intersections, roundabouts or interchanges), or walking, biking, or trail crossings.
Crash concentrations are also often found on short links such as sharp curves or steep hills.

FIGURE 10.6: NODES AND LINKS



Since crash densities differ at nodes and along links, these two types of sites should be distinguished
during the identification process. Otherwise, some links could be identified as deviant simply because they
contain one or more nodes.

It is important to consider what the boundaries of a crash location are. There needs to be a defined cut-off
point, such as between crashes that occur at or because of an intersection and crashes that are considered
‘mid-block’ (i.e. on a link between two intersections). It may be necessary to look beyond these defined
boundaries when analysing crash data. For example, crashes within 10 metres on the approach roads to
an intersection may be considered as located at the intersection (‘zone of influence’ of an intersection);
however, it may be of value to look beyond this boundary for other crashes that may be related to an
intersection (e.g. 100 metres). To avoid biases at the identification stage, the same zone of influence
should be used for all similar nodes in similar road environments.

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 131/353



FIGURE 10.7: ZONE OF INFLUENCE OF A NODE



The unit length for a road link that is used at the identification stage has an impact on the choice of sites
that are detected. Overly long links can prevent the detection of local crash concentrations, which will be
diluted in the surroundings, and on the other hand, overly short links will have either 0 or 1 crash, in which
case the information is of little use. Link lengths ranging from 500 m to 1,000 m are usually adequate for
identification purposes.

Either fixed sections or mobile sections (‘sliding windows’) can be used to identify hazardous links. The use
of fixed sections is simple: a fixed origin is determined and the road is subdivided from this point into
successive sections of equal length. However, it can prevent the detection of crash concentrations located
at the boundary of two adjacent sections. The use of mobile sections that shift a constant section length,
e.g. 1 km, along the road by means of a short increment, e.g. 100 m, eliminates this problem. Detection
criteria should be set to identify the high-risk locations. Many European countries use the sliding window in
their national network analysis methodology, i.e. Austria (Nowotny, 2019; ASFINAG, 2011), Belgium -
Flanders region (Geurts and Wets, 2003), Croatia (Saric et al., 2016), Denmark (Danish Road Directorate,
2014), Hungary (Borsos et al., 2016), and Lithuania (Lietuvos Respublikos Susisiekimo Ministro, 2011).

FIGURE 10.8: COMPARISON - FIXED AND MOBILE SECTIONS



Figure 10.8 illustrates the usefulness of this method. Assuming a detection threshold of 7 crashes/km, the
crash concentration located between kilometres 1.5 and 2.5 would not be detected with a fixed section,
but it would be with a mobile section.

Computerized databases now simplify the use of mobile sections and increase the possibilities. For
example, the beginning of each constant section could coincide with the exact location of each crash in the
database, which increases accuracy while avoiding useless computations. Hauer (2004) instead
recommends using not only variable starting points but also sections of variable lengths.

The crash location is also generally identified as the point at which an impact occurred. However, this may
only be the end point of a sequence of events. Factors relating to the cause of the crash may have started

earlier on the roadway.

Crash locations can sometimes be poorly or inaccurately defined, and it is important to consider this when
comparing crash sites. There are a number of different methods used to determine the location of a crash.
In built-up areas, the common practice is to measure the distance from the nearest intersection, junction
or landmark using some distance measuring device. However, in rural areas and in some countries in
general, names may not exist for all roads, and junctions may be few and far between. Other common
systems are the Linear Referencing System and Link-Node System. These two rely on road names or
reliable kilometre post markers along roads. In many countries hectometre points (or milepost) on road are
a part of infrastructure for a very long time. Those signs are helping to identify number and kilometre (or
milepost) of the road. Now more and more common is to use Global Positioning Systems (GPS). This is the
recommended system for data accuracy. Gathered in this way latitude and longitude coordinates may
show us the exact location more precisely. For roads where the infrastructure does not contain kilometre
and/or hectometre (milepost) signs it is important to consider if it is more effective to invest directly into a
GPS solution because of its advantages in locating crashes. See Chapter 5. Effective Management and Use
of Safety Data and WHO (2010) for more detail on using reliable and accurate data to identify high risk
locations.

Over time, especially in HICs, there has been a movement to the assessment of more extensive areas,
including route-based approaches. The term ‘Network Safety Management’ is used in Europe to
encompass an approach that assesses extended routes, typically between 2 and 10 km (Schermers et al.,
2011). These segments have higher than expected numbers and severity of crashes when compared to
other similar segments. Various tools have been developed to help with this process, and some of the key
approaches are discussed below.

DECIDING ON A TIME PERIOD

Typically, a three- to five-year period is selected to provide a large enough sample of data for statistical
reasons (regression to the mean), whilst minimising the chance of changes to the road network. In some
LMICs, high risk locations and crash patterns within a location may start to form after just one to two years.
Once a strong pattern has been established, especially where fatal and serious injury crashes are
occurring, it is more important that treatments are implemented earlier rather than waiting up to three or
even five years for more data. When selecting the time period, it is important to use whole years to avoid
cyclic or seasonal variations in the crash and traffic data. It is also important to be aware of any changes in
database definitions that may have occurred in that time or the presence of periods to be excluded due to
exceptional events that have caused significant changes in the traffic data and thus crash data (e.g. wars,
epidemics such as Covid, etc.).

CRITERIA FOR SELECTING LOCATIONS TO INVESTIGATE FOR TREATMENT

There is generally not enough funding to treat all identified crash locations. Even if the funds are available,
funding and other resources constraints may not allow for immediate investment or make it necessary to
invest over a longer timeframe. Selection criteria are therefore required for prioritising crash locations for
further investigation and treatment. It is strongly recommended that fatal and serious injury crash types
be used for the selection of sites, as per the Safe System approach (see Chapter 4. The Safe System
Approach). However, minor injury crashes should not be ignored as they may be indicative of a potential
fatal or serious injury crash in the future. The selection process varies depending on the aim of the project
and the types of actions that may be considered, and include:

Site action – treating a specific site or short length of road that has a concentration of crashes.

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 133/353



Route action – investigating crashes along a section of road, looking for common crash
characteristics along the route, but also individual problematic sites.
Area action – investigating crashes throughout an area, where the main issues to be addressed
may be on a broader scale, such as traffic management and network problems (e.g. pedestrian
safety may be a recurring theme).
Mass action – this looks for common crash characteristics over a larger area, such as
delineation problems or vehicles running off the road.

There are several existing methods to identify crash locations, using the following criteria:

Crash clusters.
Crash frequency.
Crash rate.
Critical crash rate.
Equivalent Property Damage Only (EPDO) index.
Relative Severity Index (RSI).
Combined criteria.
Crash prediction models.
Empirical Bayesian methods.

For most of these methods, crash locations should be selected based on the same definitions for location
(e.g. the same radius or route length, where this is applicable) and the same time period in order to allow
for a direct comparison. However, for some methods, the data can be normalised to allow direct
comparison (e.g. converted to crashes per kilometre, crashes per year, etc.).

CRASH CLUSTERS

At the most basic level, the presentation of crash locations on a map can provide information on crash
clusters. In the absence of a more sophisticated crash database system, this provides a quick indication of
crash locations by frequency. Figure 10.9 shows an example of crash locations overlaid on a map for an
urban area. In this figure the larger the circle, the higher the number of crashes. Maps are a powerful way
to present information to key stakeholders, including technical staff, policy makers, senior managers,
members of the public and politicians. As they are easy to understand by all of these stakeholders, they
can be a strong advocacy tool. Another very useful tool in this regard are heatmaps, which make it
possible to identify areas with a high number of crashes or fatalities or injuries based on the data shown.

ANALYSIS SYSTEM - CAS)



CRASH FREQUENCY

Crash frequency is the simplest identification criterion. Each crash is located at its point of occurrence on
the road network and the total number of crashes reported at each site being considered is added up.
Sites are ranked in decreasing order of crash frequency.

A detailed safety analysis is warranted at each site where the crash frequency exceeds a selected
investigation threshold (IT). This threshold may be set arbitrarily, e.g. although it should preferably take
into account the available budget.

This approach allows the identification of a road site where the number of crashes is significantly higher
than an established threshold value, which can be set arbitrarily, although it should preferably take into
account the available budget. For example, a site with five or more crashes per year, or a road section with
a crash frequency of 3 crashes per kilometre per year in a rural area might be classified as hazardous if
the average crash frequency for the entire network is 2 crashes per kilometre per year.

The procedure and an example of application is shown in Appendix 10.2 (Crash Frequency).

Advantages

Simplicity of the criterion.
Sites with a high crash frequency are necessarily detected.
Focus on crash reduction (collective risk).

Disadvantages (see box below)

Bias towards high traffic volume sites.
Does not take into account crash severity.
Does not take into account the random nature of crashes.

Crash frequency – Main shortcomings

Bias towards high traffic volume sites

Crashes are generally seen to increase with traffic flow. The strength of the relationship between
these two variables has allowed the development of numerous statistical models that estimate the
number of crashes at a specific location solely on the basis of traffic flow functions. Relying on the
crash frequency criterion to identify deviant sites may then prevent the detection of such sites with
low traffic flows. Various identification criteria that take into account traffic flow have been defined,
with the crash rate being the most popular.

Crash frequency and severity are not necessarily linked

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 135/353



The trauma severity resulted in a crash depends on several factors, some of which are directly
related to road characteristics: impact speed, roadside conditions, collision type, etc. For example,
traumas are on average much less severe in rear-end collisions occurring in urban areas than in
head-on collisions occurring in rural areas. Some crash types and road environments are therefore
likely to cause more severe crashes than others. Identification criteria that take into account the
trauma severity have been developed.

Crash frequency varies between two observation periods

Even if all conditions could remain unchanged at a site, the number of crashes occurring each year
might fluctuate significantly. The relative importance of these fluctuations is directly related to the
long-term average of the annual number of crashes at the site considered - the lower this average,
the higher these variations. This is a result of the random nature of crashes, and it introduces two
types of bias to the identification process: some sites that are not deviant will be identified as being
so and vice versa (see section Selection Bias in Appendix 10.1). Some identification criteria reduce
these biases.

More detailed information on this issue can be found in AASHTO Highway Safety Manual (2025) and
Austroads (2021). These help in the identification of high-risk crash locations, particularly those of higher
severity. It is important to note, however, that although high-risk locations should be targeted for
treatment, they may only make up a small proportion of the network that is responsible for deaths and
serious injuries. In these instances, additional proactive responses may also be required (see Section 10.4
Proactive Identification).

Figure 10.10 shows an example of road safety levels map based on fatal crash risk concentration for
national roads in Poland. More detailed maps for smaller regions together with maps representing fatal
crash acceptance risk levels, costs density class risks and costs density acceptance levels are also
available. All the maps are prepared in accordance with polish national regulations (Dziennik Ustaw

CRASH RATE

This approach identifies a site where the crash frequency is unusually high relative to its traffic volume.
The crash rate, which is the ratio of crash frequency to traffic volume, indicates the level of risk exposure.
Traffic volume is the most commonly used exposure unit (Figure 10.11):

At road intersections (nodes), the traffic considered is the sum of entering vehicles.
On road links, it is the sum of vehicles travelling in both directions. The length of the link must
also be accounted for.

FIGURE 10.11: TRAFFIC CONSIDERED FOR CRASH RATE CALCULATION



©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 137/353



This criterion requires the definition of an arbitrary threshold for identifying high risk locations.

The procedure and an example of application is shown in Appendix 10.2 (Crash Rate).

Advantages

Takes into account traffic exposure.
Is the most widely used identification criterion, which facilitates comparisons.
Focus on the probability of being involved in a crash (individual risk).

Disadvantages

Traffic volume must be known at each site.
Does not take into account the random nature of crashes.
Bias towards low-traffic roads (a random variation of a few crashes per period will significantly
modify the crash rate value at such sites).
Does not take into account crash severity.
Assumes a linear relationship between traffic volume and crashes; this may be a source of
error.

CRITICAL CRASH RATE

This criterion makes use of methods originally developed to conduct quality controls in industry (Norden et
al., 1956). It compares the crash rate at a site with the average crash rate calculated in a group of sites
having similar characteristics (see Appendix 10.1).

As for the other criteria described in this section, the basic assumption is that sites having similar
characteristics should have similar safety levels. Despite this assumption and due to the random nature of
crashes, a site's crash rate may very well exceed the average crash rate of its reference population
without being necessarily hazardous. However, when a site's crash rate becomes too high compared to
similar sites, random variations no longer suffice to explain the observed difference. The site is then
considered to be deviant.

This criterion calculates the minimum crash rate value at which the site is considered hazardous.

The critical crash rate value increases with the chosen statistical level of confidence.

FIGURE 10.12: AVERAGE CRASH RATE AND CRITICAL CRASH RATE



The procedure and an example of application is shown in Appendix 10.2 (Critical Crash Rate).

Advantages

Takes into account the random nature of crashes.
Takes into account traffic exposure.

Disadvantages

Complexity of the method.
Does not take into account crash severity.
Assumes a linear relationship between traffic volume and crashes this may be a source of error.

This criterion, together with crash density, are also used in the reactive approach of the European
Commission's Network Wide Road Safety Assessment (NWA) methodology for identifying high-risk
locations (EC, 2023) based on the Directive 2008/96/EC as amended by the Directive (EU) 2019/1936.

EQUIVALENT PROPERTY DAMAGE ONLY (EPDO) INDEX

A common method of identifying high-risk locations to take account of severity is to prioritize sites through
a crash cost analysis. An effective method often used is the Equivalent Property Damage Only (EPDO)
Index, where crashes are weighted according to their severity. For instance, fatal crashes are assigned the
highest cost/weighting per crash and property-damage-only (PDO) crashes (or minor crashes if PDO crash
data is not collected) are assigned the lowest cost/weighting per crash.

The EPDO index attaches a greater importance to more serious trauma by ascribing to each crash a weight
that is a function of the worst level of injury sustained by one of the crash victims. Thus, a crash causing
minor injuries to two individuals and a serious injury to a third person is rated a serious crash. A crash that
seriously injures two people has the same rating. Various weighting factors have been suggested in
different countries, based on the social cost of crashes. Below an example of weighting factors proposed
by Agent (1973):

Property damage only crash (PDO): 1.
Minor injury crash: 3.5.
Serious injury or fatal crash: 9.5.

The procedure and an example of application is shown in Appendix 10.2 (EPDO).

Advantages

Takes into account crash severity.
Simplicity of the criterion.

Disadvantages

Does not take into account traffic exposure.
Does not take into account the random nature of crashes.
Bias towards high-speed sites (rural roads).
Does not take into account aspects not related to infrastructure or user behaviour (such as
vehicle type and age, use of active and passive vehicle safety devices, etc.) for the severity of
crashes.

The weighting factors attributed to each category of severity usually fall well below the actual cost of these
crashes. The values recommended by Agent (1973) are still often used in North America. With similar
values, greater but not disproportionate attention is given to more severe crashes.

The use of weighting factors that correspond to the real cost of crashes could lead to the underutilization
of less serious crash data as it would take up to several hundred PDO crashes to equal one serious crash
(Table 10.2). However, the repeated occurrence of crashes at the same location is a good indicator of
road-related deficiencies that should not be overlooked, and the occurrence of a single severe crash at a
location may very well not be related to prevailing road conditions.

RELATIVE SEVERITY INDEX (RSI)

This criterion is based on the following considerations:

1. The severity of trauma sustained in any given crash is affected by several factors, such as the
impact speed, impact point on the vehicle, type of vehicle, age and health condition of the
occupants, protection devices, etc. Consequently, two crashes of the same type occurring at the
same location may cause quite different trauma levels.

2. The average crash severity, as computed on a large number of similar crashes having occurred in
similar road environments, is seen as a more stable indicator than the trauma level sustained in a
single crash.

Standard crash costs are assigned to crashes by crash type and road environment, as shown in the

These costs are calculated based on an analysis of the average crash severity of each crash type. It is
important to note, however, that crash types and crash costs will differ between jurisdictions and
countries. This method takes into account crash severity but places less emphasis on locations where a
single fatal crash may skew outcomes because of its very high cost. Such an outcome might be the result
of a ‘random’ event, never to be repeated. This is more likely on lower volume roads or road networks
where fatal crashes are very infrequent. Of higher interest are locations, routes or areas where high
severity events are likely to happen again in the future. Using average crash costs by crash type, a crash
cost can be assigned to each location, and then locations ranked by total crash costs.

The procedure and an example of application is shown in Appendix 10.2 (RSI).

Advantages

Takes into account crash severity.
Reduces the influence of exogenous variables having an impact on crash severity.

Disadvantages

The development of the cost grid may be complex.
Does not take into account traffic exposure.
Does not take into account the random nature of crashes.
Bias towards high-speed sites (rural roads).

COMBINED CRITERIA

In some cases, multiple identification methods are used. These use two or more of the methods identified
above.

Various combinations of criteria can be used to reduce the shortcomings of individual criteria (Table 10.4).

CRITERION BIAS TOWARDS

Crash rate Low-volume sites

EPDO, RSI High-speed sites

For illustration purposes, three possible variants are described:

Combined thresholds.
Individual threshold.
Individual threshold with minimum values.

Combined thresholds

More than one investigation criterion is used to detect deviant situations, e.g. a crash frequency
of 5 or more crashes per period and a crash rate of 3.0 or more crash/Mveh-km.
All investigation thresholds must be reached in order for a site to be detected.

Individual threshold

More than one investigation criterion is used to detect deviant situations, e.g. a crash frequency
of 5 or more crashes per period and a crash rate of 3.0 or more crash/Mveh-km.
A site is detected if at least one investigation threshold is satisfied, regardless of the value of
the other criteria.

Individual threshold and minimum criteria values

Sites are ranked in decreasing order of one criterion. Minimum investigation thresholds are set
for the other criteria considered, e.g. ranking sites by crash rate and keeping only those sites
with a minimum of 3.0 crashes per period.

The procedure and an example of application is shown in Appendix 10.2 (Combination of Frequency and
Rate).

EMPIRICAL BAYESIAN METHOD

EB method is considered one of the most reliable approaches for selecting crash locations; that method
provides a way to combine a site’s crash history with the crash history of several sites having similar
characteristics (reference population) in order to calculate the site’s adjusted crash frequency (fEB). This
adjusted frequency is seen as a better approximation of the long-term average crash frequency on which
safety decisions should be based. At first, the method of moments has been proposed to combine these
two pieces of information, but multivariate statistical models are seen as a more practical method for this
purpose.

The main problem associated with the use of empirical Bayes methods lies in the difficulty of defining
homogeneous reference populations (Elvik, 1988). In order to overcome this problem, Hauer suggests
using statistical regression techniques to develop crash prediction models (or ’safety performance
functions’ – see Crash Prediction Models) that serve as reference populations. Details are explained in

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 143/353



some Hauer's articles (Hauer, 1992, 2002, 2004), but the basic principles are as follows:

1. A multivariate statistical model (safety performance function), that relates crash frequencies to a set
of independent variables, first needs to be developed and the value of the overdispersion parameter
must be estimated during this development. This model is used to calculate a site’ s predicted crash
frequency (fpj).

2. The adjusted crash frequency at the site fEB is computed by combining this predicted crash
frequency (fpj) and the number of crashes reported at the site (fj). The relative weight attributed to fpj
and fj is related to a weight parameter (w), as shown in [EQ. 10.1].

where:

fpj = predicted crash frequency at site j

w = weight of the predicted crash frequency

When ‘w’ increases, more importance is given to the crash frequency calculated with the safety
performance function and when it decreases, more weight is given to the site crash frequency.

3. The value of ‘w’ is influenced by the relative homogeneity of the reference population that has been
used to develop the statistical model (as expressed by the over dispersion parameter) and it is also
influenced by the value of the number of crashes predicted by the safety performance (as this
frequency increases, more importance is placed on the site crash frequency).

Advantages

Takes into account the random nature of crashes.
Improves the accuracy of the estimated potential for improvement.

Disadvantage

Relative complexity.

CRASH PATTERNS

A road network’s safety deficiencies are usually identified by using one or more of the criteria described in
Criteria for Selecting Locations to Investigate for Treatment. Such criteria detect crash concentrations,
although the nature of the problems encountered is generally unknown at the time of identification. A
complementary identification approach, which consists of searching for deviant crash patterns, may also
be considered.

If a clear crash pattern can be found for which a cost-effective treatment is known, an action may be
justified even though the overall crash frequency is not abnormally high. For example, a concentration of
night-time crashes at a site may justify the installation of a road lighting system even though the overall
number of crashes is not abnormal.

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 144/353



Given that the ‘normality’ is strongly influenced by the characteristics of the site being analysed, a
comparison between crash features at the site and corresponding features at similar sites is recommended
(see section Reference Population and Potential for Improvement in Appendix 10.1).

In order to identify deviant patterns with an acceptable level of confidence, the number of crashes
considered must be sufficiently high. Consequently, this identification approach is more suited to the most
frequent collision types, at locations where traffic volumes are high and for larger sites (route, area,
network).

Various statistical techniques can be used to identify deviant accident patterns. The following paragraph
describe how the properties of the binomial distribution can be applied to this end.

BINOMIAL PROPORTION

The properties of the binomial distribution can be used to calculate the probability of observing a number
of crashes of a given type i at a site j(fij) when the total number of crashes at this site (fj) and the average
proportion of this type of crash in a population of similar sites (pi) are known:

where:

fij = frequency of type i crashes at site j

fj = total crash frequency at site j

pi = average proportion of a type i crash in the reference population

Accordingly, the probability of observing fewer than fij crashes of type i at site j is:

And the probability of observing fij or more crashes is:

When P(Fij > fij) is low, the frequency of the type of crash under study is abnormally high.

The procedure and an example of application is shown in Appendix 10.2 (Binomial Proportion).

CALCULATOR: BINOMIAL TEST

CONCLUDING REMARKS

Crash sites can be assessed using statistical analysis to identify sites that are experiencing a statistically

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 145/353



significant number of crashes in a set time period. This can be useful to distinguish between sites that are
experiencing abnormally high crash rates and those that are merely experiencing variation due to chance.

Sites identified as hazardous may differ depending on which identification criterion is used. As mentioned
previously, the crash frequency tends to detect more sites with higher traffic flows, while the crash rate
detects more sites with lower traffic flows and crash severity detects more sites in rural environments.
Each of them highlights problems from a different perspective and it appears as a good practice to analyse
the safety performance of a road network from more than one angle:

A high concentration of crashes at the same location is in itself a strong indicator of a road
related problem that should warrant a safety diagnosis.
The crash rate measures the level of risk faced by road users. When road users travelling at a
specific location face an abnormally high risk, corrective actions should be taken.
Reducing road fatalities and injuries should be the ultimate objective of any road safety action
and accordingly, it is sensible to give special attention to those sites where more severe
crashes occur, regardless of traffic.

The combination of empirical Bayesian methods and multivariate statistical models are seen as a more
accurate and reliable method of identification of road safety problems (than traditional methods) as it
reduces selection biases related to the random nature of crashes. While this increased sophistication might
not be necessary when problems are obvious, which is likely to be the case in the early stages of road
safety interventions, the application of these methods can be greatly facilitated by making a proper use of
inexpensive computer technologies.

It should be recognized that other identification strategies can also be quite useful for detecting deviant
sites:

Detection of the worst sites of a road network, using the criteria described and ranking sites in
decreasing order without considering the reference population to which they belong.
Detection of a safety deterioration at a site between two crash periods; the Poisson test is
recommended for this purpose (see Appendix 10.1 - Random Nature of Crashes).

CALCULATOR: POISSON TEST

The crash identification process allows for sites to be selected for further investigation. Using any of the
abovementioned methods, a shortlist can be developed containing sites that will be considered for
treatment. Available funding will limit the number of sites that can be treated, and so the shortlisted sites
should be assessed through site inspections and an initial crash diagnosis to identify where cost-effective
treatments can be implemented.

CASE STUDY - Germany: Accident Hot Spot Management

Thinking that road traffic crashes are exclusively the result of driver fault is still quite popular - but it
is also wrong. In many cases, poor road infrastructure systematically contributes to a high number of
crashes ('crash hot spots'), understanding the problems leading to those crashes, finding solutions to
improve the situation and then evaluating after some time if a crash hot spot has been worked on
successfully. This case study highlights the process of identifying hot spots, analysing crash hot

CASE STUDY - Spain: Application of Connected Vehicle Data to Improve Road Safety in
Diversions, Roundabout Design, and Urban Crossings

Identifying which segments of the roads present problems for road users is difficult for road
administrations. Often, it is through the identification of crash hotspots using statistical methods that
road operators can determine when a stretch has inadequate design or conditions. Currently, with
existing technology, it is possible to use other types of information from vehicles themselves to help
complement this type of identification. Proper processing of "big data," including parameters related
to road and the vehicles themselves allows us to have a better understanding of the traffic conditions
of a particular stretch of road. This facilitates the design of measures to improve both the level of
service and road safety on that road. Read more

DIAGNOSING THE CONTRIBUTING FACTORS TO CRASHES
Diagnosing the contributing factors to crashes is the foundation for selecting an effective solution to a
safety problem. To properly understand the problem, one must consider that:

A crash is the result of a sequence of events and circumstances (rather than a single cause).
Each event or circumstance is linked to a component of the Safe System – the persons involved,
the vehicle, or the road environment.
Each event is strongly influenced by the preceding event or circumstance.

Diagnosis of the contributing factors at a crash location is a four-step process:

Gather the relevant information about the site, such as crash data, traffic volumes, and the
history of the network or location in terms of land use or physical layout changes.
Analyse the crash data for the location (e.g. the whole area if looking to perform mass action
plans, or a single site for treatment implementation) by looking for common crash types or
factors, particularly those that are happening in groups.
Inspect the site from the perspective of the road user, and closely examine the site’s physical
features and layout, understand the human factors and human behaviours that may be
contributing to crash occurrence or outcomes.
Based on the notes and findings from the above steps, draw conclusions about the likely
contributing factors to the crash groupings (of similar type and/or location).

These stages are discussed in further detail in the sections below. The NCHRP Report ‘Diagnostic
Assessment and Countermeasure Selection: A Toolbox for Traffic Safety Practitioners’ (National
Academies, 2024) offers a valuable resource for diagnosing crash contributing factors and selecting
appropriate countermeasures.

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 147/353



When conducting a diagnosis, analysts may have to consult technical references in order to better
understand whether a road component can contribute to a given safety problem or could improve the
situation. Technical Sheets describe the relationship between several road features and safety (horizontal
alignment, vertical alignment, intersection, etc.). Some technical data may also need to be collected at the
site to make progress in the diagnosis. Technical Studies explains how to conduct various technical
studies: spot speed, traffic count, etc.

Results obtained at each of the abovementioned four steps may be closely related. For example, a safety
deficiency at a horizontal curve is likely to be detected during both the crash analysis step (large
proportion of single-vehicle crashes) and the site observation step (isolated sharp curve). In other cases,
the conclusions of each step will be complementary. For example, the crash analysis may detect a cluster
of nighttime collisions, which will focus the analyst’s attention on problems that may not have been
detected by a daytime field survey. It is therefore highly recommended to complete all the steps of the
diagnostic process, even when a solution seems to have been found at the beginning of the analysis.

Given that each site has its own combination of road characteristics, road users and vehicles, the list of
potential safety problems and relevant solutions is quite long. When conducting a safety diagnosis, the
analyst should verify the following points:

The differences between the site features and established standards or practices.
The complexity of the driving task and the compliance with drivers’ expectancies.
The coherence of the road environment

Sometimes, desirable actions may extend beyond road engineering work. The range of measures that may
be implemented to improve safety is quite wide. It should be clear that the realization of a safety diagnosis
requires knowledge not only in road engineering, but also outside this field (human factors, vehicle
engineering, statistics, etc.). The analyst has to determine whether the most appropriate treatment is
related to the road or to other components of the safety system.

The analysis of complex cases for which there is no obvious solution requires the contribution of a
multidisciplinary team of experts who together are more likely to develop a good understanding of the
problems encountered and to propose appropriate solutions. Accordingly, it is important to ensure that
efficient coordination structures and communication channels are developed between the main groups
playing an active role in road safety, in order to allow constructive interdisciplinary exchanges leading to
the implementation of optimal solutions.

From the standpoint of road safety engineering, it is also important to keep in mind that problems may
originate at different stages of development and operation of a road network: planning of the
transportation system, road designing, construction, operation and maintenance (some examples are
listed on the next page).

The ability to make a good safety diagnosis is therefore highly related to the experience and ‘sound
engineering judgment’ of the analyst who, after having conducted several of these studies, will know how
to recognize situations that increase the collision risk. Obviously, this is a knowledge that cannot be
learned only from textbooks, but the process described in this section should help those with less
experience in gaining a better understanding of the underlying principles and logic of their work.

GATHER RELEVANT INFORMATION

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 148/353



Crash data is the most important information and should be available from either the Police or road
authority or leading road safety agency. The road agency may also have information on traffic volumes
and any historical information about the site such as a layout plan, any changes in traffic patterns or land
use, and any previous or current concerns raised by the community or stakeholders.

All this information should be gathered and analysed at the beginning of the diagnosis to:

Be informed of problems identified in the past and actions taken.
Avoid duplication of effort - if no major change has occurred at the site, some technical studies
may not have to be repeated.

ANALYSE DATA

The analysis of the available crash data is a fundamental step of a safety diagnosis as it helps in gaining a
better understanding of problems that have been experienced by road users travelling at the site. As a
result, analysts can propose solutions that are well suited to encountered problems and will help in
reducing the occurrence of similar crashes in the future.

The crash analysis should be initiated prior to the site visit as it may influence observations that need to be
made at the site. In some cases, analysts will also have to bring additional equipment, to verify the
relevance of potential accident factors (speed gun to measure operating speeds, rods and measuring
wheel to determine available sight distance, etc.). Accident tables should be brought to the site (Appendix
10.3).

UNDERSTANDING THE CRASH

To properly diagnose safety problems, an analyst must first have a good understanding of the crash
mechanisms:

A road collision is the end result of a sequence of events occurring under specific circumstances
(rather than the ‘cause’ of a single factor).
Each event and each circumstance are linked to one of the three basic components of the
safety system - human, road environment, vehicle.
Each event is strongly influenced by the result of preceding actions and circumstances of these
actions.

The following example illustrates a hypothetical crash sequence:

An 18-year-old man who had his driving licence for six months was going for a job interview in
an unfamiliar area. He was late, tense and speeding. It was raining. His vehicle's suspension
and tires were worn. At the approach to a sharp curve after a long, straight section, he did not
see the warning sign, which is deficient under prevailing standards, and entered the curve too
fast. He encroached on the shoulder, which was unpaved, slammed on the brakes, lost control
and collided with a tree by the side of the road.

Analysts must seek to understand such chains of events and circumstances leading up to each crash in
order to propose measures that may break these sequences (Figure 10.13). Where there is not enough
information to reconstruct the course of each crash in detail, simplified analysis methods must be used.

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 149/353



FIGURE 10.13: COLLISION CHAIN OF EVENTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES



CRASH ANALYSIS LEVEL

Different types of analysis levels can be recognized based on the number of crashes considered:

The micro level, where a single crash is analysed. Typically, this analysis is conducted after a
serious crash, to accurately reconstruct its chain of events and circumstances.
The intermediate level, where all crashes having occurred at a same location with a poor
safety record are analysed to find solutions that will reduce their future occurrence. The
diagnosis process described in this section is best suited to this level of analysis.
The macro level, where a larger set of crash data is considered. It may be the set of all
crashes on a road network, all crashes involving a specific type of road user (pedestrians, heavy
vehicles), or all crashes on a given road category. Results of macro-analyses conducted on road
categories may yield useful information when conducting a safety diagnosis at a specific site,
by providing insight into problems that are likely to be encountered. Such analyses are also
conducted when developing a country’s road safety action plan and establishing a country’s
action priorities (see Chapter 6. Road Safety Targets, Investment Strategies, Plans and
Projects).

STATISTICAL CRASH ANALYSIS

Typically, crash reports contain several elements of information that may highlight potential road
deficiencies (Table 10.5).

By combining information from the collision report, the analyst may sometimes obtain results that are
similar to quasi-scenarios: heavy vehicle on grade; -angle collision at intersection at rush hour, etc.

Additional information contained in the collision report may also reveal problems that require actions on
other components of the ‘human – environment – vehicle’ system: impaired driving, young drivers,
overloaded vehicles, mechanical defects, etc.. In such cases, the appropriate authorities should be
informed of the existence of the problem.

Steps of a statistical crash analysis are as follows:

1. Preparation of crash summaries. Various crash summaries can be prepared to help identify
abnormal crash patterns. Below, three types of summaries are described: Collision diagrams,
Factor matrices, and Comparative tables.

2. Search for contributing factors. Once deviant crash patterns have been identified, the analyst
will seek to understand their causes (contributing factors) in order to determine whether road
engineering actions could efficiently prevent similar crashes in the future. The first part of the Crash
Tables in Appendix 10.3 provides practical assistance in this task. Separate tables have been
developed for nodes and links and for the most frequent accident types.

3. Search for solutions. For each crash contributing factor, there are generally several actions that
can be envisioned to improve the situation. The second part of the Crash Tables in Appendix 10.3
lists the most common treatments.

COLLISION DIAGRAM

A collision diagram is an illustrative presentation of the crashes that have occurred at a location. Crashes
are pinpointed on a diagram of the intersection or road section, showing the crash type (through standard
symbols), the direction of travel, and other relevant information (e.g. the date, time of day, weather and
lighting conditions). A number of software packages allow the automatic creation of these diagrams.

The main purpose of these data presentation types is to identify common contributing factors of crashes at
a location. Note that there are normally several factors that lead to a crash. If there is no apparent
dominant crash type that appears from the data, it can be very difficult to treat the site as it will be
difficult for anyone treatment to solve all the different issues at the site (speed management can be the
exception to this, particularly in the elimination of high severity crash outcomes). Often it can be helpful to
look at the individual police crash reports for greater detail on the crash circumstances, as this might shed
light on a common causal factor.

FACTOR MATRIX

A factor matrix takes the frequency table approach one step further and considers additional factors such
as the crash severity, year of the crash, direction of travel, type of road users, collision type, surface and
lighting conditions, time of day, and day of week. A key aspect of the factor matrix is the inclusion of the
movement code or ‘stick diagram’ to indicate vehicle movements in each collision.

COMPARATIVE TABLES

What constitutes an abnormal proportion of crashes depends greatly on the site category being analysed.
For instance, average proportions of rear-end collisions or -angle collisions at an intersection will depend
on whether the -of-way is managed by stop signs or traffic signals; the proportion of run-off the road
crashes is higher on horizontal curves than on straight alignments, etc.

Therefore, comparing crash patterns at the site under study with crash patterns at sites having similar
characteristics (reference population) will help provide a more accurate estimate of the anticipated
improvement potential. For example, Table 10.6 shows that in this dataset, a 40% proportion of rear-end
collisions is below average at an intersection with traffic signals, but above average at an intersection with
stop signs.

TABLE 10.6: EXAMPLE – CRASH PROPORTIONS AT 4-LEG INTERSECTIONS



TRAFFIC SIGNAL 45% 30%

STOPS 32% 48%

However, it is first necessary to ensure that the geometric and traffic characteristics of the reference
population are adequate; otherwise, this comparison might simply lead to the maintaining of unsafe

conditions. Appendix 10.1 discusses this problem in greater detail.

Various statistical tests can be used for this comparison and Section Crash Patterns describes how to
calculate binomial proportions to this end. Table 10.7 shows the results of this calculation for the variable
‘vehicle type’. In this example, the high proportion of crashes involving a heavy vehicle requires more in-
depth investigation.

SITE/ROUTE/AREA INSPECTION

The main purpose of an inspection is to identify any environmental or traffic issues that may be
contributing to crashes at the location. A site inspection can allow the crash investigation team to see the
location through the eyes of the road user and observe the traffic behaviours. Additional data can also be
collected, such as vehicle speeds, road features, parking restrictions and speed limits, as well as enable
the team to assess any other characteristics of the surrounding road environment.

Where possible it is recommended that a team conduct the assessment, rather than an individual. A team
approach will generally provide a more diverse range of opinions and ideas, as it is easier to generate
these through group discussion. Team members might include an expert who is trained in road safety
engineering and investigation of crash locations; and police and/or road agency staff, particularly those
who are familiar with the location. The group may also include someone new to the crash investigation,
but who has ideally undergone some form of training. This approach is essential to ensure development of
skills for future crash investigators. Guidelines on Human Factors should be considered by those
investigating sites (see Chapter 8. Design for Road User Characteristics and Compliance, and National
Academies, 2024)

Table 10.8 provides a list of possible contributing factors for different crash types (including those that
contribute the most to fatal and serious injury outcomes) that should be considered by investigators during
a site inspection. Although not listed, speed is linked to the frequency and severity of all crashes.

FIELD PREPARATION

The analyst must bring to the site the following items:

Crash tables (Appendix 10.3).
Diagnostic checklists (Appendix 10.4)
Video camera with integrated GPS and with sufficient recording media and batteries.

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 156/353



Measuring tape and measuring wheel.
Paper, pencils, ruler, and eraser.
Smart phone.

When available, the following should also be brought to the site:

Road drawings (geometric design, signing, marking, lighting, etc.).
Reports of previous studies (to verify whether problems identified in the past have been
corrected as recommended).
Conclusions of the crash analysis.

It may also be helpful to provide the following items (particularly if the site is far from the office):

Sighting and target rods (Sight Distance study).
Speed gun (Spot Speed study).
Stopwatch (Travel Time and Delay, traffic-signal timing).
Tally sheets or mechanical or electronic counter (Traffic Count).
Tape recorder.
Level (superelevation).

For the analysts’ safety, also provide:

Reflective vest.
Safety helmets and boots (when necessary, e.g. in a work site).
Rotating beacon and other required road signalling equipment.
Police assistance (when necessary).

SITE FAMILIARIZATION

The main objectives of the site familiarization are to detect obvious problems and to understand the main
difficulties encountered by drivers at the analysed site. Upon arrival, the analyst drives through the site at
the same speed as other drivers and in all permitted directions. The distance to be covered depends on
the type of road environment and the nature of the suspected problems. In urban areas, a distance of a
few hundred meters in each direction is usually sufficient. In rural areas, the distance to be covered may
be much longer and extend up to several kilometres when the problem may be related to a violation of
drivers’ expectancies. The analyst must also complete pedestrian manoeuvres.

While driving along the road, it is useful to record a geolocalised video from the vehicle. This allows the
team to watch the video at a later stage and capture details that may have been lost during the site visit.
It is often useful to select someone unfamiliar with the area to do the driving so that they can experience
the location as others would for the first time. Often there will be a need to drive through the site several
times. Sometimes it is also useful to inspect the site at different times of the day or days of the week to
check for any variability in traffic flows or lighting/visibility conditions. For example, if a high number of
night crashes have occurred, night inspections are essential.

Various types of problems can be detected during the site familiarization:

Hazardous road or roadside characteristics (restricted sight distance, inadequate signing,

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 157/353



hazardous roadside conditions, etc.)
Hazardous traffic conditions (severe traffic conflicts, high speed differentials, excessive delays
etc.)
Risky behaviour (poor compliance with traffic, rules, excessive speeds, tailgating, etc.)
Expectancy violations or inappropriate driving task requirement (inadequate transition zone,
multi-branch intersection, etc.)
Obvious coherence problem (commercial stand on highway shoulder, non-local traffic on
residential street, etc.)
Insufficient maintenance (faded markings, worn road signs, overgrown vegetation, etc.)

FIGURE 10.16: EXAMPLE – OBVIOUS PROBLEMS TO BE DETECTED DURING THE SITE FAMILIARIZATION



DETAILED OBSERVATIONS

At this stage, the analyst:

1. Makes observations related to problems that have been found in the previous steps of the diagnosis,
i.e.:

Verifies whether problems that have been identified in the past at this site have been
successfully treated.
Completes the determination of possible crash contributing factors and potential
solutions.
Analyses problems that have been detected during the site familiarization.

2. Checks whether problems that are frequently encountered at similar sites are also found at this site.
3. Observes traffic conditions. Excessive delays and travel times may cause road-user frustration,

leading to risky behaviour, such as short gap acceptance, tailgating or illegal passing manoeuvres. If
these problems are observed or suspected, a more detailed analysis of the traffic conditions should
be conducted. This will always include a traffic count and a capacity analysis, and, in some
instances, additional technical studies may also be required. The analyst should also ensure that no
category of road user has an unacceptable level of risk. Frequent problems include:

Hazardous -turn manoeuvres on high-speed roads (insufficient protection).
High speed differentials (between road users at the same location or for the same road
user between two road segments).
High mass differentials (inappropriate mixes of road users sharing the road).

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 158/353



Severe traffic conflicts.
Encroachments (e.g. during turning manoeuvres of heavy vehicles at intersection).
Inadequate consideration of the needs of specific categories of road users (e.g. audible
crossing signals for blind people, longer crossing times for elderly persons, etc.).

4. Makes detailed observations of the features of the road environment (land use, speed, horizontal
and vertical alignment, sight distance, cross-section, road surface conditions, traffic signs and
markings, roadside conditions, accesses and crossings, road lighting, intersections features, etc.).
Analysts should verify that each of the features follows relevant standards or practices and assess
the associated risk when deviations are observed.

5. Assess drivers’ workload and expectancy violation. If needed, a more detailed analysis of the driving
task should be conducted.

6. Check whether road safety problems may be linked to inappropriate road user behaviour and
determine if such behaviour could be efficiently prevented by changing some road features. When
the problem would be better solved by other types of actions (e.g. education, enforcement),
contacts should be made with the agencies responsible to ensure that they are well aware of the
problem.

7. Check whether the safety problems may be related to inadequate maintenance. Frequent
deficiencies include worn road signs, faded road marking, overgrown vegetation, distressed road
surface, damaged road safety equipment (e.g. guardrails) and broken road light or traffic signal.

To ensure a comprehensive analysis, most of the above work will be performed on foot, which will also
allow for thorough photographic and written documentation of all inspection observations and findings.

DRAW CONCLUSIONS

Before summarising the analysis in a report, consideration should be given to whether any additional
information is required. For instance, if the crash analysis and/or site inspections suggest that there may
be issues with skidding, then skid resistance testing could be undertaken.

A summary report should be prepared to clearly inform readers of the conclusions that were drawn from
the analysis. This provides the basis from which treatment options are considered and selected. The report
should include a description of the area or site, results from the data analysis (e.g. crash diagrams),
observations from the site inspections, including possible contributing factors to crashes, comments on
any identified common factors leading to crashes and possible remedial measures (see Section 11.3
Intervention Options and Selection).

FIGURE 10.17: AN EXAMPLE OF LOW-COST IMPROVEMENT ON OLD MOTORWAY A-4 IN POLAND



As an example of a diagnosis, on motorways and expressways wrong-way drivers (or ‘ghost riders’) were
occasionally identified. The road authority recognised that the design should limit the possibility to travel
the wrong way on roads where the opposite directions are physically separated. Some of the engineering
solutions that were implemented long ago, were no longer recommended, but still exist and operate well
when properly equipped with traffic signs and markings. Ghost riders were also identified on new roads.
After specially dedicated inspections with road traffic specialists and police, some additional signs
minimising of the potential of unintentional wrong-way driving were installed. Solutions were adapted and
placed on other new and existing roads as shown in the photo above. These actions removed the need to
rebuild. This solution is used on new investments with practically zero additional costs.

10.4 PROACTIVE IDENTIFICATION
As mentioned in the previous section, there are established methods that help detect, prioritise and treat
high crash-risk sites based solely on prior crash history. Although these locations should be a target for
funding and attention, they only comprise a small proportion of the network that is responsible for casualty
crashes, especially in higher income countries. For example, SWOV (2010) reports that in the Netherlands
during 1987–89, only 10.5% of all fatal and hospital in patient crashes occurred at high-risk locations. In
the 1997-99 period, this had declined to 6%. For the period between 2006 and 2008, the figure was only
1.8%. This study concludes that an increasing number of serious crashes occur at locations that are not
high-risk locations.

Proactive safety actions can be employed to avoid future crashes by:

Ensuring the safest road design scheme is selected for construction.
Checking that the proposed road infrastructure or feature is designed and built to minimise the
occurrence of road safety problems.
Treating safety issues on existing road networks before crashes occur at these locations.

Various types of proactive actions have long been included in the practices of road authorities, including:

The conduct of impact studies or public inquiries during the development of road projects in
order to assess their expected effects on safety, mobility, environment, operating costs, public
acceptance, etc.
Observations at selected sites using procedures and techniques that have been developed to
assist in the detection of unsafe features, behaviour or manoeuvres.
Road network inspections in order to detect hazardous elements. Since the 1960s, guides have
been published to help in the identification of these features. (e.g. AASHO, 1967).

It should be noted that proactive actions, whilst being a preventative measure, should not be a simple
check of compliance with design standards. Often the design can meet standards, but due to the
configuration, or due to adoption of minimum standards on a number of road elements, the design may be
unsafe.

This section will discuss several types of road safety checks that are generally performed at different
stages of implementation of a road scheme. These checks may occur for a new road or road feature,
modification to an existing road or feature, and even during the usual operation of a road.

Although the focus of this chapter is on identifying risks, and the tools used in this process, some of the
approaches described also help in the identification of solutions or even in the prioritisation of
interventions (both discussed in Chapter 11. Intervention Selection and Prioritisation). The content beyond
the risk identification stage is also included in this chapter where relevant for completeness. Therefore,
this material should be read alongside the following chapter on treatment selection and prioritisation.

The road safety check types are:

Road safety impact assessments – used to ensure the scheme is selected (out of a number of
different schemes) that has the best outcome for road safety.
Road safety audits – performed to check that the selected scheme is designed and constructed

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 161/353



in such a way as to yield the greatest road safety benefits, and to detect any potential hazards
throughout the design and construction.
Road safety inspections – undertaken as part of an inspection of an existing road, or through
maintenance procedures to enable the detection of potential crash risks.
Road assessment programmes – typically undertaken on existing roads, these quantify the
expected safety outcomes for a network, route or location.

It should be noted that safety inspection of existing roads is sometimes referred to as an audit of existing
roads in some countries, but the terms refer to a similar process.

The aim of each of these road safety checks are similar, however, the main distinction is in the timing and
scope of the procedures, as shown in Figure 10.18. Road assessment programmes are typically used to
assess roads that are already in use, but recent developments have extended this to include assessment
of road design.

Given the different timing and scope of each procedure, all can be undertaken in parallel. It is up to
individual countries as to which procedures are adopted. Each has different advantages and weaknesses,
and these are documented in the following sections.

FIGURE 10.18: SEQUENCE OF ROAD SAFETY CHECKS DURING THE DESIGN STAGES



Some of the main objectives and benefits of undertaking any of these road safety checks include (PIARC
2012a):

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 162/353



The future minimisation of crash risk, severity and occurrence at the site and on adjacent roads.
Recognising the importance of considering safety in road design.
Reducing long-term operating/maintenance costs and the need for remedial work (through
efficient and safe design selection).
Bringing an increased awareness to road safety issues and solutions amongst policy-makers
and scheme designers.

The different road safety check types are thoroughly outlined in a number of national guidelines, some of
which are available internationally. Example guidelines are provided throughout the remainder of this
chapter.

Other tools to assess safety at the planning and development stage are included in Section 9.4
Management Tools. Some of these tools are designed for use by practitioners with little or no road safety
experience and are intended to identify and address risk at the earliest stages of project and programme
development.

Road safety checks generally follow a similar managerial procedure. This is outlined in Figure 10.19, which
also indicates who has responsibility for each stage of the process.

FIGURE 10.19: STEPS INVOLVED IN A SAFETY CHECK AND ALLOCATION OF RESPONSIBILITY



ROAD SAFETY IMPACT ASSESSMENT
Road safety impact assessment is conducted for infrastructure projects at the initial planning stage before
the infrastructure project is approved. It indicates the road safety considerations which contribute to the
selection of the proposed solution and provides all relevant information necessary for a cost-benefit
analysis of the different options assessed. This allows a comparison of the impact of different road or traffic
schemes on safety performance. These could be for a new road or for modification to an existing road. This
is a procedure that should first be performed in the initial planning stage of a project to assist in the

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 163/353



selection process for major infrastructure projects and should then be continually reviewed during the draft
design phase. Safety impact assessment often precedes Road Safety Audit, but is done as a
complementary process. As identified in Examples of Infrastructure Policies, Standards and Guidelines in
Section 9.3 Policies, Standards and Guidelines, impact assessment is required for all infrastructure projects
on the primary network as part of an EU Directive.

There are five main steps to a road safety impact assessment, as outlined by Eenink et al. (2008):

1. Establish the baseline situation (year zero). This should be a measurement in terms of traffic
volumes, crashes per road type, and therefore risk factors per road type. A site inspection is
required to collect this data (see Diagnosing the Contributing Factors to Crashes) for further detail
regarding site inspections). The site inspection should consider all road users, the surrounding road
network, topography, local amenities and activity centres, local weather conditions, previous road
safety reviews, and any complaints received from the community regarding the site.

2. Determine the future situation without any implemented measures (known as the ‘Do Nothing’ or
‘Do Minimum’ scenario). This should consider current circumstances and conditions and should
account for traffic growth.

3. Determine the future situation under each of the applied road safety schemes. This should include a
wide variety of alternatives and an estimate of the effects per road type. It should consider each
road user group for each of the schemes. Each scheme should be measured in terms of its impact on
the number of crashes and crash severity through a crash prediction model (see AASHTO, 2025).

4. Perform cost-benefit analysis for each possible road safety scheme. This is done by assigning a
monetary value to the safety impacts of each scheme and allows for the schemes to be ranked in
order of effectiveness.

5. Optimize the plans of each scheme. This is done to achieve the optimal safety effect and best cost-
benefit rating.

A detailed final report should be completed at the end of the road safety impact assessment. This should
include such details as:

The definition of the problem and project objectives (both in terms of infrastructure changes
and road safety).
How the road network will be affected by the proposed scheme.
Analysis of the existing road safety problems on the current network.
Analysis of crash history in the area.
Consideration of the consequences of the ‘Do Minimum’ approach.
A detailed description of each alternative road scheme.
Comparison of each scheme, including cost-benefit analysis from a safety perspective
compared to the ‘Do Minimum’ approach. This is the main element of the report and an
assessment of the effectiveness of each scheme must be made in terms of predicted crashes.
Ranking of the scheme options, ordered in terms of the road safety savings.

During a road safety impact assessment, it is important to ask certain questions. Are the road safety policy
targets realistic or ambitious? Are there other cost-effective schemes that have not been considered yet?
Are the selected schemes suitable, not just in terms of safety, but in terms of other issues such as impacts
on the environment, or accessibility and connectivity for all road users? Are there any associated social
issues, such as a lack of support from the community?

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 164/353



It is important to note that a road safety impact assessment does not replace a road safety audit; it is
merely a preliminary step towards selecting the most beneficial design for a project. Road safety audits
are essential for ensuring all hazards are identified throughout the design and construction processes,
which will be discussed in detail in Road Safety Audit.

Part C of the Highway Safety Manual (AASHTO, 2025) provides information on crash prediction models for
different road types, including rural two-lane, two-way roads, rural multi-lane highways, and urban and
suburban arterials. It covers both undivided and divided roadway segments, and intersections with various
control devices and numbers of legs. This can be used to predict the expected average crash frequency,
which is determined based on traffic volumes and roadway characteristics. Based on the foundations and
framework set by the Highway Safety Manual, other models have also been developed, such as the
European PRACT models, which can be used for different infrastructure characteristics typical of European
countries (Karathodorou et al., 2016).

BOX 10.1: THE HIGHWAY SAFETY MANUAL AND ASSOCIATED TOOLS

The Highway Safety Manual (AASHTO, 2025) was developed to help embed safety considerations in
decision-making relating to roadway planning, design, operations, and maintenance. A number of tools
have been developed to support these objectives, including Safety Analyst (discussed in Section 9.4
Management Tools), the CMF Clearinghouse (see Section 11.3 Intervention Option and Selection), and
the Interactive Highway Safety Design Model (IHSDM).

The IHSDM is a suite of software for evaluating the safety and operational effects of geometric design
decisions (from design plans). These are advanced safety analysis and prediction tools and considered
‘best practice’ by many safety professionals (see e.g. Schermers et al., 2011).

The development of these tools is based on a wide and robust range of research including on crash
prediction models and crash modification factors (CMFs) undertaken mainly in North America over the
last 15 to 20 years. IHSDM is particularly useful for selecting the safest option from a list of possible
options and for understanding the safety trade-off that might result from a lower standard design that
may be required due to site constraints or construction cost savings. This tool uses crash prediction
models and CMFs to predict crash occurrence. The models and CMFs are continually being refined as
new research becomes available. IHSDM has calibration procedures that allow it to be customised for
each US state or for other jurisdictions. Testing of these procedures has occurred in some European
countries as well as Australasia.

ROAD SAFETY AUDIT
A road safety audit is defined as a formal and independent technical check of a road scheme design and
construction, to identify any unsafe features or potential hazards and to provide recommendations for
rectifying them during all stages, from planning to early operation (PIARC, 2023; ETSC, 1997; TII, 2017;
Highways England, 2019).

The main aim of a road safety audit is to identify and address any road safety issues. A road safety audit is
not a check against design standards, but a hazard detection tool. A road scheme, when audited, should
be analysed under all operating conditions and consider all road users (motorized and non-motorized).

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 165/353



Road safety audit is a cost-effective measure for identifying and addressing likely safety issues. The earlier
the audit is undertaken, the greater the benefit, as adjusting design plans can be a cheaper option than
retrofitting safety features once a scheme has been built. Several studies have documented the benefits of
conducting road safety audits. As an example, Macaulay and McInerney (2002) estimated that a sample of
design stage audits had a benefit cost ratio (BCR) of between 3:1 and 242:1 by implementing all the
recommendations from individual audits. In addition, 75% of recommendations had a BCR greater than 10,
and 90% of recommendations had a BCR greater than 1.

Road safety audits (as well as other proactive methods) are very important for LMICs, as they provide an
opportunity to develop a culture of road safety amongst those responsible for the planning and delivery of
road infrastructure. On this basis alone there is a very strong case for the development of a formalised
process for road safety audits for all major infrastructure projects. The Kazakhstan case study provides an
example of some of the added benefits that can be gained from large road safety audit projects in LMICs.

CASE STUDY - Kazakhstan: Road safety audit of 1,062 km of road

There was a need to establish safe and efficient transport corridors along the Western Europe to
Western China International Transit Corridor. Relevant standards including road design safety
standards and available data about road crashes were reviewed. The designs of sections not yet
under construction or finalized were audited and other sections in the stages of pre- and post-traffic
opening inspected. This process involved training of 16 participants from different institutions related
to the Ministries of Transport and of Internal Affairs. PIARC guidance on road safety audit and safety
inspection was used as the basis for this work, but was tailored for local use. Read more

Many international guides exist on how to conduct road safety audits. PIARC developed a Road Safety
Audit Guide (PIARC, 2023) that provides a comprehensive step-by-step procedure on how to conduct a
road safety audit, as well as providing detailed individual checklists for motorways, inter-urban and urban
main roads at each of the design stages (feasibility study, preliminary design, detailed design, and pre-
and post- traffic opening). The guide also provides checklists for road safety audit, which are discussed in
more detail below. Other useful guides include the FHWA Road Safety Audit Guidelines (FHWA, 2006), the
Austroads Guide on Road Safety Audit (Austroads, 2022) and the CAREC Road Safety Audit manual (ADB,
2018). The African Development Bank (AfDB, 2014b) has released guidance that is specifically intended for
use in the LMICs.

As identified in Section Examples of Infrastructure Policies, Standards and Guidelines in Section 9.3
Policies, Standards and Guidelines, the EU Directive on road infrastructure safety management states that
road safety audit be conducted on all infrastructure projects on the Trans-European Transport Network
(Motorways and Primary Roads) and other EU-funded roads, and suggests that these should also occur for
all national roads. The Directive also states that such audits should be conducted at the draft design,
detailed design, pre-opening and early operation stages. This is also the approach of the United Kingdom
(Highways England, 2019). Many countries, on the other hand, provide for additional audit stages at the
feasibility stage (e.g. Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, Qatar, South Africa) and/or during works (e.g. USA,
Qatar, South Africa).

Austroads (2022) also introduces thematic audits that consider specific road user groups (e.g.,

pedestrians, cyclists, heavy vehicles) and their unique needs and interactions with infrastructure. These
audits often require specific methods (e.g., cycling audits conducted from a bicycle) and may benefit from
involving representatives of relevant user groups (e.g., elderly, disabled).

The PIARC (2023) guide identifies three parts in the auditing process – commissioning, undertaking and
completion. Details on each of these stages are provided in that document, together with the roles and
responsibilities of the parties involved.

The selection of an appropriately skilled audit team is an important part of the commissioning phase of the
audit process. It is essential that the team is independent of the design team, freeing them from
constraints imposed during the development phase and allowing them to examine the project with ‘fresh
eyes’. The size and make-up of the team will vary depending on the size and complexity of the project and
the stage of audit being undertaken. It is important that the team members, and particularly the team
leader, have the necessary training to undertake a road safety audit. Auditors typically require strong
expertise in road engineering and road safety investigations. For complex projects, supplementing the
team with specialists in relevant areas such as transportation and land-use planning, traffic engineering
(operations and maintenance), vehicle dynamics, human factors, etc., may be appropriate.

Many countries have developed formal training requirements (sometimes referred to within national
guidance on road safety audit) and registers of appropriately qualified auditors. For smaller projects, it
may be possible for a single auditor to complete a ‘road safety check’, and although this is not ideal, it is
certainly preferable to no audit at all.

Audits rely on existing design standards, but they must go beyond a simple verification of compliance with
standards, which may be unsatisfactory in some circumstances:

‘‘Applying standards and practices without considering prevailing circumstances is no
substitute for judgement, and brings no assurance of an acceptable end product. Equally,
designs prepared without referring to generally accepted standards and practices are not
likely to serve the travelling public as intended. Designs based on a combination of sound
professional judgment, applicable standards and current practices will generate the most
effective highway…’’ (Professional Engineers of Ontario, 1997)

The availability and development of suitably skilled road safety auditors is an important challenge for
those in the LMCIs. Capacity can be increased in the short term by training of key staff (either within their
own country, or through established courses in HICs). In the medium term it is desirable to establish
capacity within a country to train auditors. This will typically require some form of longer term ‘train the
trainer’ approach, whereby a small number of experts are provided with advanced training and on-going
support. These experts then develop skills through experience to a point where they are in a position to
train others.

Many countries have developed checklists for conducting road safety audits. These checklists provide
examples and reminders of issues that should be assessed by audit teams during their assessment. They
are useful to ensure that key issues are considered, but it also needs to be recognised that every situation
differs, and therefore checklists should typically be used as guides only and as a way of ensuring that no
aspect has been missed. They do not form part of any formal audit report. This is because there may be
other issues identified during an audit that were not anticipated by the existing checklist. Different
checklists have been developed for different stages of the road safety audit process, or for thematic
audits.

One criticism of road safety audits in the past is that the recommendations from the audit are not
implemented. It is therefore critical that there be a process to complete the audit, including a formal
response to the report. This should document a response to each of the actions recommended; and in
cases where recommendations have not been accepted, the reasons for this and any other mitigating
strategy that will be undertaken to help minimise risk should be stated. This written response to the audit
report should become part of the project documentation.

Harwood et al. (2014) suggested that audit could be a costly method for identifying interventions, and that
there is potential to miss interventions that could be added that are cost-effective ways to improve safety.
Also, economic assessment of interventions is typically not included unless conducted as an addition to the
normal audit process. On the positive side, they suggest that audit is a useful way to identify safety
features that are missing or in poor condition, and that they are a good way to bring together expert staff
to review safety. They also identified advantages in conducting field reviews (i.e. site inspections), a
process not always undertaken in other methods of risk assessment. However, benefits of road project
audits have been clearly demonstrated in studies. Typically, audits account for less than 4% of the total
design costs, but they produce significant returns in terms of crash savings and cost-effectiveness
(Austroads, 2022).

It is important to note that the road safety audit process has been around for many years. It was first
established in the late 1980s, with documentation developed in many countries from the 1990s. However,
there has been increasing adjustment of the road safety audit process to include Safe System concepts as
part of auditors’ ongoing training and updates to processes. In some countries, the focus is shifting to
better capture issues related to eliminating death and serious injury, although this has always been an
integral part of the audit process. The focus remains primarily on road-based deficiencies and the solutions
are generally aimed at improving the road environment. In many situations, this approach may be
adequate; however, to take a Safe System-based approach, some jurisdictions have developed
assessment frameworks that could be considered Safe System audits. These differ to traditional audits
because they focus attention on the reduction of fatal and serious casualties and/or take a more holistic
view of problems (and solutions) involving each of the Safe System pillars (e.g. safe user issues such as
fatigue, potential for speed related crashes). The Australia case study provides one such example.

CASE STUDY - Australia: Application of the safe system approach through safe system
audit/review

In 2007, the Commissioner of Main Roads Western Australia directed that the road safety aspiration
for a major road project would be zero deaths within the first five years of operation and the
minimum condition of satisfaction would be a 10% reduction compared with best practice for the
context of the road (i.e. a 10% improvement over existing best practice design). As the best design
standards of the day were to be complied with and thorough road safety audit/review processes were
to be applied (as per normal practice), it was unclear how road safety could be further improved. A
new approach that focused attention on the fatal and serious injury crash risks was developed and
applied. This provided a structured approach to the assessment of the project against Safe System
objectives. Read more

A further example was developed by the Department of Planning, Transport, and Infrastructure (DPTI) in

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 168/353



South Australia. This involved a full Safe System assessment for a major project and was used as part of a
successful business case to government to secure funding. The approach differed from a typical audit
because it assessed vehicle and behavioural issues as well as the typical infrastructure issues.

Interestingly, some of the vehicle and behavioural issues identified were able to be addressed through
infrastructure changes (also see the discussion in Section 8.2 Designing Infrastructure to Encourage
Behaviour).

In a recent development, quantified audits have been undertaken to determine the impact of new design.
Changes can be made to this design and likely safety improvements determined. An example of this
approach is provided in Section 9.4 Management Tools.

The international Road Assessment Programme (iRAP) has developed a technique to star rate design plans
(SR4D). Details on this approach can be found in the case study in Section 9.4 Management Tools.

PEDESTRIAN AUDITS
Recognizing the critical need to improve pedestrian infrastructure quality and safety, PIARC developed the
Walkability Checklist and the Checklist for Quality and Safety Inspections of Pedestrian Infrastructure. Both
of these checklists are discussed in detail in the following article: Pedestrian Audits - A Checklist for Safety
and Quality Inspection of Pedestrian Infrastructure (Schmitt & Gerlach, 2018). The intent of these
checklists is to find optimal solutions for walking and sojourning. The checklists incorporated Rumar's order
of problems approach, where these orders of requirements are defined in three levels (Rumar, 2002). The
first level requirements are those visible, tangible and concrete requirements concerning the physical
environment, pedestrians, vehicles and the behaviours of other road users. The second order requirements
concern the tactical level facilities and services, such as how the network is designed and operates, the
traffic rules, and enforcement, management of the system and other like elements. The third order
requirements allow the first and second order requirements to be met. These include land use
characteristics, mode split, pedestrian quality, the culture, and other aspects that relate to the ease and
desire to walk. The Walkability Checklist considers the design of the roadside environment as first order
requirements, with traffic rules and traffic flow as second order requirements. The checklist recognise that
requirements go beyond objects, facilities and services to consider context, process and procedures. The
Walkability Checklist reviews pedestrian quality elements and whether general walkability requirements
are fulfilled. The Checklist also helps define the stakeholders' responsibilities for the walkability
requirements under consideration and what procedures need to be applied.

The Checklist for Quality and Safety Inspections of Pedestrian Infrastructures (CQSI) builds upon the
Pedestrian Quality Needs (PQN) Inspection process. In general, the PQN is a systemic onsite expert review
of the walking condition requirements through identification of hazardous conditions, faults and
deficiencies that reduce pedestrian demand, conditions, comfort and safety. Because the PQN considers
the quality and safety concerns of the pedestrian infrastructure, the CQSI was developed as the next step
to the PQN. The checklist is intended to identify all of the relevant deficiencies of the pedestrian
infrastructure. The photo below provides an example of a pedestrian deficiency that might be identified
through the pedestrian audit process.

ROAD SAFETY INSPECTION
The PIARC Road Safety Inspection Guideline for Safety Checks of Existing Roads (2012a) defines a road
safety inspection (RSI) as a systematic, on-site review of an existing road with the aim of identifying
hazardous conditions, faults and deficiencies that may lead to serious crash outcomes. An RSI must be
carried out by an independent, qualified individual or team with the relevant experience, and is specific to
existing roads, not those under construction. It is also a proactive method in that the prevention of crashes
is achieved through identification of potential safety issues, rather than responding to recorded crashes in
a crash location investigation.

Road safety inspections are useful as they can:

Complement high risk location treatments.
Identify issues with current maintenance procedures.
Identify locations for mass action treatments (i.e. hazardous features across a whole road
network).
Allow for proactive treatment of potential crash locations (before crashes occur).
Check for consistency of road features.
Check for adequacy of traffic management features.

The PIARC (2012a) guide identifies the following topics as necessary to be covered during an RSI, as well
as some of the questions a safety check team should be considering during an investigation:

Road function – is the road/speed limit appropriate for the role it plays in the network?
Cross-section – is the road wide enough? Are the line markings sufficient? Are the road surface
conditions adequate?
Alignment – how do the horizontal and vertical alignments interact? Are sight distances
adequate?
Intersections – is the intersection layout and design appropriate for the volume of traffic passing
through and the turning movements?

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 170/353



Public and private services – are there sufficient deceleration/acceleration lengths leading up to
and away from service and rest areas? Are the parking and loading facilities for public transport
sufficient?
Vulnerable road user needs – have pedestrian, cyclist, scooter/moped and motorbike rider
needs been accounted for?
Traffic signing, line marking and lighting – are traffic signs and line markings appropriate and
clear? Is the site well lit?
Roadside features and passive safety installations – are there roadside obstacles present that
may pose safety issues?

There are four main steps to a road safety inspection on an existing road.

Desk study.
On-site field study.
Road safety report.
Implementation of remedial measures.

An on-site field study component of RSI has evolved in recent years. Survey vehicles can be equipped with
automated devices to measure and record design and road management elements (e.g. horizontal and
vertical alignment, super-elevation, pavement surface condition, presence of roadside hazards, road
inventory etc.). This information can be assessed to detect issues with routes, such as anomalies in
curvature (e.g. unexpected severe curves), slippery road surface or presence of roadside hazards. New
technologies for road surveys have evolved significantly in recent years with the progress of AI, focusing
on enhancing accuracy, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. Some of the most popular are: LiDAR (Light
Detection and Ranging), Drones (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles - UAVs), Mobile Mapping Systems (MMS), etc.

Further details on this data collection can be found in Section 5.4 Non-Crash Data and Recording Systems.

A road safety inspection of an existing road aims to detect features that may lead to future crashes, and
past crash information is not always a good indicator of this. Crash investigation and prevention
programmes look at features that contribute to the occurrence and severity of crashes that have already
happened. An RSI does not require crash data, but it can be a useful tool in terms of providing guidance
towards prioritising which roads should be inspected. For instance, if the road authority only has enough
funding to inspect a select number of roads, priority can be given to roads with a high number of crashes
per kilometre, or crashes per traffic volume. More detail on prioritisation of policies, projects and
treatments can be found in Section 11.4 Priority Ranking Methods and Economic Assessment. Road safety
inspections can be a useful complement to reactive approaches, such as high crash location investigations.

Sometimes RSI is undertaken on specific themes, for instance to identify issues relating to pedestrians or
bicycles. This approach has been developed even further in France, where a method involving a specially
equipped bicycle has been established to assess the bicycle network (Cerema, 2010). Further information
on this approach can be found following this link.

An RSI is not the same as a routine maintenance check, where issues such as vegetation, road surface
inconsistencies and poor quality signage are reviewed and remedied. However, an RSI can identify safety
issues that are a result of poor maintenance, such as poor signing, line marking or visibility issues.

Road safety inspections can lead to:

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 171/353



The identification of inadequate road management practices.
The initiation of new works programmes.
Changes in prioritisation of existing programmes.
Changes to maintenance procedures to meet road user needs.

Human factors are a crucial part of identifying hazards at a site. Further discussion on this issue can be
found in Chapter 8. Design for Road User Characteristics and Compliance.

Road safety inspections can be performed on the whole road network or on specific locations that are
regarded as being the greatest risk. This is dependent on the road authority. It is important to note that
road safety inspections of existing sites can result in a huge number of identified hazards and road safety
issues. Under these circumstances, it is not economically viable to attend to all the issues listed. There is
also little benefit to conducting an RSI on a site if the resources will not allow the majority of hazards to be
addressed following the inspection. Sometimes it is more beneficial to invest in a maintenance programme
to address a number of issues rather than conduct a formal RSI.

The PIARC Road Safety Inspection Guideline for Safety Checks of Existing Roads (2012a) provides a
number of helpful checklists for different road types to ensure that each investigation of a site considers all
the necessary elements. The checklists are similar in nature to those used for road safety audit. The guide
also provides examples of appropriate RSI reports for both inter-urban and urban main roads. The African
Development Bank (2014c) has released guidance on Road Safety Inspection that is specifically intended
for use in LMCIs.

ROAD ASSESSMENT FOR SAFETY INFRASTRUCTURE
The proactive approach has been extended with a method that takes a quantified approach to the
inspection of existing roads and road designs. Although several approaches exist, the most commonly
applied is the Road Assessment Programme (RAP). Different RAP programmes exist in different regions,
including usRAP, AusRAP, KiwiRAP and ChinaRAP. These all fall under the global banner of iRAP (the
International Road Assessment Programme). PIARC (2012b) notes that the iRAP approach is of great
benefit where crash data is unavailable, or coverage is limited.

RAPs take the concept of road safety audit and inspection a step further by estimating the risk (based on
likelihood and severity) for different road sections based on road and roadside characteristics. A number of
road elements are collected (e.g. through video and subsequent desk-based assessment; also see Section
5.4 Non-Crash data and Recoding Systems). Based on research conducted over many years, a lot is known
about each of these variables, and the level of risk each produces. As an example, a straight section of
road is safer than a road with a severe bend, and this risk level can be quantified. Each of the variables is
quantified and an algorithm determines the risk of a fatal or serious injury for each segment of road (iRAP
uses 100 m segments).

Such an assessment can be used to identify the highest risk and lowest risk segments of a network or
road. A five-star rating system is used, with a one-star road providing the poorest road infrastructure, while
on a five-star road the likelihood of a crash occurring and the severity of those that do occur is lowest. This
information can also be colour-coded to provide a quick visual indication of road infrastructure safety. The
process also allows separate star ratings for different types of road user (i.e. the vehicle occupant,
pedestrian, bicyclist and motorcyclist).

The information can also be used to identify safety improvements that may be implemented, both at

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 172/353



specific locations and across a whole network. Calculations can be updated to determine the likely safety
benefit from such improvements. With knowledge of treatment costs and their benefit, as well as
estimates of fatal and serious crash outcomes for a road network, an economic calculation can be
undertaken to determine the most beneficial group of treatments to be applied to a road network or at a
location. The software for this analysis is available online and is provided free to road authorities to use.
Further details on this can be found in Chapter 11. Intervention Selection and Identification while a
detailed description of the iRAP approach can be found at www.irap.org.

Reflecting the strong empirical basis behind the iRAP model, there is a strong linkage between the Star
Rating of a road and the actual safety performance. An analysis performed by McInerney and Fletcher
(2013) based on Star Ratings and crash cost (the average vehicle occupant fatal and serious injury crash
costs per vehicle kilometre travelled) for almost 1,700 km of highway provides an example of this
relationship. For each reduction in star rating (i.e. improvement in safety), the crash cost roughly halved.
When moving from 1 star to 2, the crash cost reduced by 40%; from 2 star to 3 costs reduced by 61%; and
from 3 star to 4 costs reduced by 44%.

Harwood et al. (2014) assessed the usRAP tools and compared this approach to other methods of
assessing risk. They suggested that the approach was the most robust and quantitative in selecting
interventions to improve safety, and that the recommendations were accompanied by economic
assessment often missing in other methods. However, the approach was also identified as being quite
labour intensive, with reliance on collecting roadway data and the coding of this data by skilled staff.
However, they also suggested that this could be accomplished in a reasonably efficient manner. The
consideration of risks associated with specific road user groups (motorcyclists, pedestrians, bicyclists as
well as vehicle occupants) was also seen as an advantage.

A similar approach to iRAP was adopted in South Africa, with the use of Net Safe.

CASE STUDY - South Africa: Identification of hazardous locations using Net Safe

Crash statistics in South Africa are of poor quality. This makes it difficult to identify hazardous
locations and the causes of crashes. The solution involved the identification of potential hazardous
locations on roads based on the existing road elements. South African National Roads Agency Ltd
(SANRAL) developed a Road Safety Management System (RSMS) that outlines a holistic approach to
road safety on their approximately 20 000 km of roads. An element of the RSMS was the
development of the Netsafe algorithm. Read more

areas. Fatality rates in these areas were high and the communities were discontented about the road
safety situation. The case study covers a process that was developed in the City of Tshwane to
develop and implement Road Safety Master Plans, with input from communities where crash-data is

not available and road deaths are prevalent. It entails a process that was developed to also integrate
engineering, enforcement and education. Read more

CRASH PREDICTION MODELS
Over the last two decades, several researchers in Europe and worldwide, have examined the safety effects
of various elements of the road infrastructure in an attempt to quantitatively estimate or ’predict’ crash
frequency (number of crashes per year) and crash severity (level of injury due to crashes). As a result of
this research, a large amount of relevant knowledge has been developed, as well as various methodologies
and techniques to estimate future crash frequency and severity and to identify and evaluate options to
reduce them. These methodologies are commonly known as Crash Prediction Models, and they essentially
are the statistical - mathematical models behind most road assessment methodologies based on design
characteristics of roads.

These models estimate the number of crashes based on functions of independent variables. The following
simple model form is often used:

With this simple form, the influence that geometric features have on crash occurrence is taken into
account by establishing a distinct reference population for each group of sites having similar features and
by developing a model for each of these populations. For example, a model could be developed for rural
cross intersections, another model for rural T intersections, and so on.

Alternatively, the effect of key geometric road features could also be assessed by developing more
complex models that include not only traffic variables, but also geometric variables.

Two basic groups of these more complex models are present in international literature and road safety
practice, namely the US Highway Safety Manual (HSM) predictive method (AASHTO, 2025) and stand-alone
multivariate Accident Prediction Models correlating crash frequency to traffic and road geometric
characteristics, developed using specific datasets by individual researchers (and thus applicable to
circumstances similar to the ones they were developed from). Based on the foundations and framework
set by the Highway Safety Manual, other models have also been developed, such as the European PRACT
models (Karathodorou et al., 2016).

The estimate of the expected average crash frequency relies upon regression models developed from
observed crash data for a number of individual sites. Different regression models, called base Safety
Performance Functions (SPFs) have been developed for specific facility types (e.g. undivided segments of
rural two-lane two-way roads, divided segments of urban and suburban arterials, three-leg intersections
with ‘STOP’ control in rural multilane highways etc.) and ‘base conditions’, that are the specific geometric
design and traffic control features of a ‘base’ site.

The general form of the predictive models in HSM, for a given type of site, is shown in the following
equation:

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 174/353



where:

Npredicted = predicted average crash frequency for a specific year.

Nspf = predicted average crash frequency determined for the base conditions of the Safety Performance
Function (SPF).

CMF1 .... CMFy = crash modification factors.

C = calibration factor to adjust the SPF for local conditions related to the network where the model is to be
applied

The procedure and an example of application is shown in Appendix 10.2 (Crash Prediction Models).

Advantage

Accuracy.

Disadvantages

Complexity.
Does not consider the random nature of crashes.

IDENTIFICATION – A BROADER PERSPECTIVE
Most road authorities allocate a share of their operating budget to the improvement of high-risk locations
and the correction of hazardous road elements. However, due to other requirements related to the
development and operation of a road network, funding for such specific safety actions is generally quite
limited. Nevertheless, most actions taken by a road authority have a safety impact, whether they are
initiated for safety reasons or not. If these impacts were properly assessed, crashes could be avoided,
often at little or no cost. The implementation of RSAs has marked a major improvement in that direction,
but more can be accomplished.

The following paragraphs describe how decisions are currently made by most road administrations
(Decision-making process) and then propose general solutions for better incorporating safety concerns in
current practices (How to broaden the safety perspective).

DECISION-MAKING PROCESS

Broadly stated, a road authority’s mission is to satisfy the mobility needs of people and goods and to
support socio-economic development, while ensuring that the safety and environmental impacts of the
road network are minimized.

To accomplish this mission, the following tasks need to be completed:

Gather information.
Identify action needs.
Develop projects.
Assess anticipated impacts and select actions.

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 175/353



Implement selected actions and evaluate their consequences.

GATHER INFORMATION

In order to identify the most pressing action needs, a road authority uses various sources of information.
First and most important, a reliable information system that accurately describes a road network’s features
must be established (Chapter 5. Effective Management and Use of Safety Data). Other useful sources of
information include:

Employees’ knowledge, experience, and expertise.
External knowledge (literature, experts).
Requests from road users, local population, police officers, etc.

IDENTIFY ACTION NEEDS

Based on this information, the performance of a road network is assessed in accordance with the various
organizational objectives, such as mobility, road infrastructure quality, environment, safety, and so on.
Several performance indicators have been developed to assist in this task (e.g. Table 10.6). Methods for
assessing the safety performance of a road network have been described in detail earlier in this chapter.

DEVELOP PROJECTS

Based on the identified needs, various projects are then developed. They may consist of:

Actions aimed at maintaining the integrity of the existing network (road resurfacing, trimming
of the vegetation, pavement marking, etc.).
Actions aimed at improving existing road features (installation of improved protection devices,
change from a conventional intersection to a roundabout, etc.).
Development of new roads.
Changes to existing procedures/standards/practices: work-zone management procedures,
geometric standards, maintenance practices, etc.
Legal/financial incentives or deterrents (e.g. laws, funding, taxes).

ASSESS ANTICIPATED IMPACTS AND SELECT ACTIONS

Most of these measures and actions have an impact on more than one performance indicator (Table 10.9).
For example, a road resurfacing project that improves surface quality is likely to lead to speed increases,
with secondary impacts on safety, mobility, and vehicle emissions. These various impacts should be
formally assessed.

TABLE 10.9: EXAMPLE – PERFORMANCE INDICATORS

Objective Performance indicator

• Number of trips (per road user type)

Road surface condition • Skid resistance
• IRI
• Etc.

Environment • Vehicle emissions
• Noise
• Etc.

Safety • Crash frequency
• Crash rate
• Crash severity
• Etc.

IMPLEMENT AND EVALUATE

During construction, appropriate monitoring is required to ensure that the implementation conforms to
proposed plans and does not lead to the introduction of new road hazards.

Evaluations should also be conducted after a project's completion in order to ensure that anticipated
benefits have been achieved and to ascertain that adverse effects have not been introduced into the
system. Results of these evaluations will also contribute to improve the efficiency of future actions.

A schematic representation of this decision-making process is shown on Figure 10.21 below.

HOW TO BROADEN THE SAFETY PERSPECTIVE

MORE SAFETY ASSESSMENTS

As defined previously, a road safety audit is a formal assessment of the safety performance of a road
project or an existing road conducted by a team of independent experts. There is a need to expand the
scope of these safety evaluations to include activities of a road authority that are not currently submitted
to this type of evaluation but do have an impact on safety. These include:

Road projects that are not audited.
Procedures, programs and practices.
Road-related laws and regulations (e.g. load and size limits).
Incentives or deterrents (e.g. public transport funding).

BETTER USE OF AVAILABLE DATA, KNOWLEDGE AND TECHNOLOGY

Crash data, which are expensive to collect, are often underused, particularly in light of recent
technological advances that significantly enhance the range of analyses that can be conducted with
reasonable effort. The organization of this data and the development of user-friendly programs that
facilitate the extraction and analysis of this information should become a priority.

Simple query programs should be made available to decision-makers, allowing them to make more
informed decisions. More sophisticated programs should be developed for safety analysts, in order to help
them using recent analysis methods and techniques. And finally, easy access to existing databases should
be provided to researchers, allowing them to extract a maximum of information from these systems.

Software that facilitates the use of knowledge that has been gathered on road safety - partly through the
use of available databases - should also be developed. A major effort in that regard is the American
‘Interactive Highway Safety Design Model (IHSDM)’ software, which is designed to help engineers take
greater account of safety impacts when developing new road projects (see Box 10.3).

IMPROVED COMMUNICATION CHANNELS WITHIN ROAD AUTHORITIES

Engineers who develop new projects and safety experts often work in independent departments, with each
having their own objectives and budgets. Designers typically believe that by following existing standards,
they will necessarily develop safe projects, but experience shows that this is not necessarily the case. On
the other hand, safety experts often work exclusively on the development of specific road safety programs
(e.g. blackspot improvement program). The development of formal and informal communication channels
between the various specialists in a transportation agency, and their partners is needed: working groups,
ad hoc meetings, control points, joint seminars and social events should all be organized.

10.5 COMBINING CRASH DATA AND ROAD DATA
Both the historical crash-based approach (reactive) and the assessment of risk through proactive means
provide information on likely future crash locations. Combining these two approaches can provide a fuller
picture of current risk locations, and where fatal and serious injury (FSI) casualties are most likely to occur
in the future. Several approaches are emerging around the world that attempt to combine these methods
to provide a fuller understanding of crash risk.

A ‘systemic’ safety project approach has been in the USA since the mid-1990s, first used by the
Washington State Department of Transportation and recently throughout the USA (Preston et al., 2013).
The systemic approach focuses on network- wide solutions and has been used by numerous states in the
USA. The System Safety Project Selection tool was developed by Federal Highway Administration in the
USA. This approach involves several steps, drawing on both crash data as well as other sources of
information to identify and treat risk. The steps are as follows:

Analyse road crash data – by system (state and local level), road type, location, and location
type (urban/rural, divided/undivided, intersection/segment), with a focus on severe crashes.
Identify crash locations:

By selecting crash types and facilities with the greatest number of severe crashes
across the system.
By identifying and evaluating crash risk factors through examining the traffic
volume, roadway/intersection features, posted speed limit, etc.
By prioritising locations through conducting a risk assessment and prioritising
roadway facilities.

Prioritise programmes – through a countermeasure selection decision process, developing
safety projects and prioritising their implementation.
Rank projects – by determining the distribution of safety funds among the projects identified
through site analysis and systemic risk assessment.
Evaluation – of consistency (whether the programme met the spending goals), changes in
severe target crash types, and countermeasure performance.

The systemic approach identifies treatment sites that are not typically identified through traditional
reactive analytical techniques (see Section 10.3 Crash-based Identification (‘Reactive’ Approaches)).
Central to this approach is the risk assessment approach, which involves the collection of roadway and
traffic characteristics that relate to the selected risk factors and crash types. This is used to help identify
the potential for locations or road segments to have severe crash outcomes. It is suggested that such
information be collected either from existing road and traffic databases or collected as part of a field
review. In an example provided by Preston et al. (2013), an assessment of curves on a rural network
identified a number of sites that had common risk characteristics as locations with severe crash outcomes,
but that did not have a documented severe crash. It should be noted that the approach can be used with
or without crash data.

Harwood et al. (2014) reviewed the systemic approach, identifying several strengths as well as areas for
potential improvement. They suggested that this approach required less roadway data than other tools,
did not require crash data to identify specific crash locations, and provided greater flexibility for target
crash types and risk factors. However, this flexibility was also seen as a possible weakness, as there is a
reliance on users to identify potential risk factors, weight these risk factors, include issues such as traffic

volume, and to conduct a cost-benefit analysis (an optional task) as part of intervention selection.

An approach has been developed in Australia that combines crash data with a more proactive approach.
The Australian National Risk Assessment Model (ANRAM) provides road agencies in Australia with a
nationally consistent system for identification, measurement and reporting of severe crash risk. ANRAM
was developed in close consultation with road agencies and the Australian Automobile Association (AAA) to
ensure that the system’s outputs could drive preparation of future road safety engineering programmes.

This was especially important for rural and local roads where severe crashes are generally too scattered to
attract traditional blackspot funding. However, it was also recognised that these scattered crashes form a
large proportion of all fatal and serious injury crash outcomes.

ANRAM draws together a number of approaches, from traditional crash-based assessment, Road
Assessment Programmes and the US Highway Safety Manual (HSM) (AASHTO, 2025). The HSM proposes a
method that identifies a level of safety performance for different types of roads. There will be individual
variation from this mean crash frequency, which may be due to each location’s variation in road features
and operational factors that differ from the mean represented by the model, and due to statistical error.
This variation in road features can be measured and the effect of this variation calculated. In the case of
ANRAM, the iRAP model (AusRAP in Australia) is used to do this. The process leads to a predicted number
of crashes based on road design elements and features. This ‘proactive’ assessment of risk forms one of
the key inputs to the identification of fatal and serious injury crash locations.

The basic structure of ANRAM is provided in Figure 10.22. Further details on this approach can be found in
Steinmetz et al. (2014).

FIGURE 10.22: STRUCTURE OF THE AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL RISK ASSESSMENT MODEL (ANRAM)



In New Zealand, the ‘High-Risk Rural Roads Guide’ (NZTA, 2011) provides guidance on the use of crash
data and predictive risk approaches (such as KiwiRAP) to determine high risk locations.

The New Zealand approach involves calculation and assessment of collective and personal (or individual)
risk. Collective risk indicates crash frequency as experienced by the community, i.e. annual average
crashes per kilometre of road being assessed. Personal (or individual) risk indicates risk to an individual
road user expressed per kilometre of travel by a vehicle, i.e. annual average crashes per vehicle-
kilometres travelled (VKT). Historical crash data (reactive) and/or predictive risk assessment (proactive) is
used. Both approaches use a scale to categorise the level of risk: high (black), medium-high (red), medium
(orange), low-medium (yellow) and low (green).

Using historical crash data (reactive approach) to identify the highest risk sections along the road, the
collective and personal risk is categorised into different risk levels. Using this information, the highest risk
sections of the road can be identified.

Alternatively, or in addition, a predictive risk assessment approach can be used. KiwiRAP star rating and
road protection scores assess road crash risk based on road infrastructure (engineering) features. Star
ratings (which typically apply to five kilometres road sections) are derived from the road protection scores
(which are calculated for each 100 m segment). Figure 10.23 provides an example of risk categorisations
that may be applied.

FIGURE 10.23: EXAMPLE OF PREDICTIVE ASSESSMENT (‘PROACTIVE’) (SOURCE: NZTA, 2011)



The New Zealand Guide recommends crash data analysis and review of key risk factors to inform
development of an appropriate treatment program to address the identified risk. Consideration of a road’s
collective and personal risk helps guide the approach to road safety investment (refer to Section 11.2
Project-Level and Network-level Approaches).

In Europe, in accordance with the provisions of Directive 2008/96/EC (as amended by Directive (EU)
2019/1936), an integrated methodology for a common Network-Wide Road Safety Assessment (NWA) and
a common safety rating system for classification of the existing road network in categories has been
developed in 2023 (EC, 2023). The methodology developed integrates proactive (in-built safety) and
reactive (crash occurrence) safety assessments. The NWA-proactive methodology ranks road sections
based on their in-built safety characteristics. Sections are classified as Low risk (class 1), Intermediate risk
(class 2), and High risk (class 3). The NWA-reactive methodology ranks road sections based on their crash
statistics. Sections/ junctions are classified as Low risk (class 1), Unsure (class 2), High risk (class 3). The
NWA-integrated methodology, based on a set of rules, combines the ranking of the two methodologies in
the final ranking consisting of 5 classes: Very High Priority (class 5), High Priority (class 4), Intermediate
Priority (class 3), Low Priority (class 2), Very Low Priority (class 1) (Figure 10.24).

More details on the methodology, its development and use can be found here.

10.6 CONCLUSION
This chapter has described several methods of identification of road safety deficiencies, making a
distinction between reactive and proactive approaches.

REACTIVE IDENTIFICATION
The main principles associated with the use of reactive (or crash-based) methods have been described in
Section 10.3. Simple criteria and more sophisticated ones have been described. This should fit the needs
and possibilities of every road authority.

As it has been described in Section 10.3, the reactive identification is based on the principle of potential for
improvement that can be expected from modifications made to existing road or traffic conditions.
Notwithstanding the advantages of this identification strategy, it should be recognized that there are also
other ways to detect deviant sites. For instance, it is possible to search for the worst sites of a road
network, without considering its reference population, or search for sites with recent road safety
deteriorations.

Section 10.3 has also explained that a reactive identification may also be targeted at the detection of sites
with an abnormal concentration of one or more crash types (with or without problems in terms of overall
crash frequencies). This is, again, another way of looking at the identification task that may yield
interesting results

Explanations related to the reactive identification and the example of Appendix 10.2 have been adapted to
the case of high-risk location detection. As described in the introduction, the correction of those sites is
generally the first safety action taken by a road authority due to its high cost-effectiveness. However, it
should be clear that a comprehensive identification of road safety deficiencies should extend beyond the
identification of those sites and include a search for larger entities that may consist of:

Parts of a road network (e.g. an administrative region, a city, etc.).
Roads or long road segments.
Groups of sites, rather than individual sites (highways, four-leg signalized intersections in urban
areas, horizontal curves in rural areas, etc.).
Methods to identify such locations are quite varied; It could be:

A comparison of the safety performance of different areas of a network (e.g.
detection of administrative regions having more safety problems).
A comparison of road categories or road entities, leading to the detection of unsafe
types of entities (e.g. X-shaped intersections).
Crash pattern analyses conducted on large entities (e.g. high rate of pedestrian
crashes in a municipality or high frequency of fixed-object crashes on rural roads).

Identification criteria that have been described in Section 10.3 may be used for these analyses. They will
often lead to the development of specific safety programs aimed at the simultaneous correction of several
sites having the same problem (mass action). Such programs will typically be included in a national road
safety action plan (as would be a high-risk location correction program or a safety belt usage program).
Examples could include a roadside improvement program in rural areas, or a program aimed at increasing
the protection of pedestrian crossing manoeuvres in urban areas).

PROACTIVE IDENTIFICATION
Proactive identification methods, which are now largely cantered on the application of road safety audit
procedures, and road safety assessment have been described in Section 10.4. These are activities that
have expanded significantly since 1990’s and a continuing trend is to be expected in the coming years.

But efforts should also be devoted to the development of a more comprehensive approach to road safety
improvement. Accordingly, Identification – A Broader Perspective has described a global decision-making
process of a road administration and made some suggestions for a better integration of safety concerns in
the current practices of road authorities. To become more efficient in making strides toward safer roads, it
is believed that profound organizational changes are required. The identification task should not be limited
to the detection of safety deficiencies of a road network - either using proactive or reactive methods - but
should also include, in a more positive manner, the search for safety opportunities.

10.7 PATHWAY TO EFFECTIVE ASSESSMENT OF
RISKS AND IDENTIFICATION OF ISSUES

GETTING STARTED
Guidance documents on the assessment of risk should be adopted by road agencies, and
training provided for key staff and external stakeholders on treatment of high crash
locations, impact assessments, road safety audits, safety inspections, and road
assessment programmes.
Policies and processes should be put in place by road agencies to embed these
approaches as part of core business.
Investigation of high-risk routes and areas should be undertaken to identify locations with
a high incidence of fatal and serious crash outcomes. Demonstration projects should be
instigated at these locations as a way of improving safety, but also to assist in building
capacity and engaging with key stakeholders.
Where available, crash data should be used to help assess high risk locations. Where crash
data is not available, collection should commence, at least on high-volume, high-risk
routes.
Presentation of crashes on maps is an easy way to identify high crash locations and can be
a useful starting point to address crash risk.
Data on safety-related road elements (e.g. through safety audit and road assessment
programmes) should be collected to identify high risk locations. Other survey data (such
as speed surveys) can also help identify high risk locations. This is particularly useful in
the absence of accurate crash data.

MAKING PROGRESS
Review and internationally benchmark existing guidance documents and approaches on
risk assessment and update to ensure these are in accordance with international good
practice.
Refine adopted road safety tools to ensure that they meet local needs and reflect good
practice. Ensure core road agency staff and stakeholders (internal and external) are
adequately trained in these tools and approaches and applying these in their role. This
includes staff responsible for national, regional and local roads.
Ensure that risk on all roads is investigated to determine locations with a high incidence of
fatal and serious casualties. This should include through the analysis of crash data and
safety-related road elements. This data should be integrated with other safety-related
information (including behavioural survey results) to help identify risk locations, as well as
effectively manage road safety outcomes through a performance management
framework.

CONSOLIDATING ACTIVITY
Continue to review and internationally benchmark existing guidance documents and
approaches on risk assessment and update to ensure these are in accordance with
international good practice.
Continue to refine tools and adapt them to meet local needs. Ensure that these tools are
used by all relevant stakeholders.
Ensure all relevant staff and stakeholders (internal and external) are adequately trained in
these approaches and applying these in their role. Develop systems to ensure staff and
stakeholders maintain high levels of skill.
Continue to investigate risk on all roads to determine locations with a high incidence of
fatal and serious casualties. This assessment should utilise all relevant sources of
information, including a combination of crash data, safety-related road elements and other
safety-related information.

APPENDIX 10.1 - METHODOLOGICAL ASPECTS
REFERENCE POPULATION AND POTENTIAL FOR IMPROVEMENT
Several road features have an influence on crash risk. Main rural roads, which are designed and operated
following higher standards than those for secondary rural roads, are usually safer in terms of crashes per
vehicle-km.

On any given road, the safety level is not constant. For example, crash densities are generally lower on
links than at nodes, due to differences in the number of traffic conflicts. At nodes, T intersections are
generally safer than + intersections for the same reason, and so on.

Consequently, the potential for improvement depends to a large extent on the nature of the site under
study and on the modifications that can be envisioned.

Distinct reference populations should therefore be defined to help determine what constitutes a
representative safety level for a given type of site. Such populations are defined by taking into account the
main road features having an impact on safety. For example, a reference population may be defined for
two-lane + intersections in urban areas with stops on the minor legs, another population for T intersections
on similar roads, and so on. Given the significance of traffic flows with respect to crashes, distinct
reference populations should ideally be developed for different combinations of traffic flows.

The establishment of reference populations requires a good knowledge of both crash contributing factors
and available data that quickly limit the number of possible populations that can be defined. In practice,
the development of statistical multivariate models is often used to circumvent data limitations.

RANDOM NATURE OF CRASHES
One of the main problems arising from the use of crash data to detect safety deficiencies has to do with
the random nature of these events.

To make it easier to understand this concept and its consequences, let’s use a die as an analogy. A toss of
the die is also a random event, whose result depends on the number of sides of the die and the value of
each side. On a standard six-sided die, the range of possible values is simple: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. When a die
is thrown many times, each side should come up an equivalent number of times and the resulting mean
value of such throws is 3.5: (1 + 2 + 3+ 4 + 5 + 6) / 6 = 3.5. This value can be described as the die's
‘long-term average’. When the die is thrown only a limited number of times, for example three times, the
mean obtained may vary between extreme values of 1 and 6. If this result is used to estimate the die’s
long-term average, accuracy will vary greatly. Similar variations also occur with crash frequencies. The
number of crashes occurring at a site over a one-year period (f) can be compared to one throw of the die,
while its long-term average crash frequency (m) can be compared to the die’s long-term average. From a
statistical standpoint, the throwing of the die is said to follow a uniform distribution, while crashes follow a
Poisson distribution.

Poisson distribution

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 191/353



where:

p(f;m) = probability of observing f crashes given that the safety level is m

f = crash frequency

m = safety level

This is a fundamental equation in road safety analysis. It can be used to calculate the probability of a given
crash frequency (f) when the safety level (m) is known. For example, if a site’s m value is 5 crashes/year,
the probability of having exactly 1 crash/year is 3.4% while the probability of having 6 or more crashes is
38% (Figure 10.A1). The ‘Poisson test’ calculator can be used to calculate this latter probability.

CALCULATOR: POISSON TEST

FIGURE 10.A1: POISSON DISTRIBUTION FOR M = 5



Each site of a road network has its own ‘m’ value based on its set of characteristics (continuing the dice
analogy, there would be several dice, each one with a distinct number of sides and values).

In practice, difficulties arise from the fact that the safety level (m) is unknown and that it must be
estimated (m ̂) from the reported crash frequencies (f).

A calculator (CALCULATOR: CONFIDENCE INTERVAL ) is provided to estimate the uncertainty of ‘m’ based
on an observed crash frequency.

This estimate of m becomes more statistically reliable as the period increases but it may be less
representative of the prevailing conditions if changes have occurred at the site during the period

considered. To avoid this type of bias, relatively short crash periods are often used (3 to 5 years).

REGRESSION TO THE MEAN
The regression to the mean phenomenon is common to a number of random events and consists of a
general tendency for extreme values to return to median values. Sir Francis Galton, who noted that
children of tall parents were usually shorter, and vice versa, was the first to identify regression to the
mean in the 19th century (Galton, 1886). The phenomenon also applies to crashes. When the crash
frequency is abnormally high during a certain period, it tends to decrease during the subsequent period
and draw closer to the site’s long-term average (and vice versa).

SELECTION BIAS
The random nature of crashes and the difficulty of extending crash periods as much as might be necessary
to reach sufficient accuracy create two types of biases during the identification phase, i.e. normal sites
may be detected as being unsafe and unsafe sites may not be detected. Figure 10.A2 below, drawn from
Hauer and Persaud (1984), illustrates the problem. The rectangle represents all the sites of a road
network. Ellipsis 1 represents all the unsafe sites (those with a high ‘m’ value). It is solely at these sites
that a treatment is warranted. Ellipsis 2 represents sites that were detected as being deviant during the
identification phase (those with a high ‘f’ value). Four types of situations can arise (domains A to D):



FIGURE 10.A2: SELECTION BIAS (SOURCE: HAUER & PERSAUD, 1984)



The objective of the identification stage is to obtain the best possible superimposition of ellipses 1 and 2
and to limit areas A and C. Identification techniques that take into account the random nature of crashes is
seen to reduce selection bias.

Procedure Example

1. Locate all crashes reported during the period of
analysis

2. Define the different reference populations


3. For each reference population:
• Calculate the total crash frequency and the Two-lane rural roads
frequency of each type of crash considered, at Surface conditions (reference population and section
each site #45): Of the 12 crashes reported on section #45, 7
• Calculate the proportion of each type of crash have occurred under wet-surface conditions (58%). The
considered in the reference population equivalent proportion in the reference population is

27%.

• Calculate P(Fij ³ fij) based on [EQ. 10.4]
For wet-surface conditions: The probability of observing
0, 1, ...6 wet surface crashes on section #45 and the
corresponding cumulative distributions are shown in

the table below.
The probability of observing 6 or fewer wet-surface
crashes is 98%. Consequently, the probability of
observing 7 or more crashes is only 2% (i.e. the
frequency of wet-surface crashes at the site is
abnormally high).

CRASH PREDICTION MODELS
Procedure Example (see Tables 10.A2 and 10.A3)

1. Locate all crashes reported during the period of analysis

2. Define the different reference populations

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 199/353



3. For each reference population:
• Determine the crash frequency and traffic volume at each site. Two-lane rural roads
• Develop the crash prediction model for the reference population. Columns 2 and 3 in Table A10.2.2

The following model has been fitted to the 55 sections of this
example:
fp = 0.0084 Q0,76

where:
fp = predicted crash frequency / 3 years
Q = average annual daily traffic (AADT)

• Calculate the estimated crash frequency at each site using the
crash prediction model (fpj) For section 1:

fp1 = 0.0084 × 60500,76 = 6.07 crashes/3 years
Column 10 in Table A10.2.2
fp range from 1.31 to 7.84 crashes/3 years

• Calculate the potential for improvement (P.I.) at each site.
P.I.j = fj - fpj For section 1:

P.I.1 = 9-6.07 = 2.93 crash/3 years
Column 11 in Table A10.2.2
P.I. range from 4.56 to 8.43 crash/3 years

• Rank the sites according to their potential for improvement
Sections 10, 45, 1, 36 and 52 have the highest potential for
improvement

The following table presents a summary of the results obtained with the numerical example.

It shows that:

Section 10 has been detected by 6 of these 8 identification criteria. Clearly, this section has a
safety problem. When the problem is obvious, the choice of the identification criteria has less

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 200/353



impact on the selection of sites.
The crash frequency criterion detected mostly those sections with high traffic volumes (with the
exception of section 10, every section detected has a daily traffic volume of more than 6,000
vehicles, while the average AADT is 4,400 vehicles). On the other hand, the crash rate criterion
detected mostly sections with low traffic volumes (with the exception of section 10, every
section detected has a daily traffic volume of fewer than 2,000 vehicles). This is a typical result
for these criteria.
Three criteria make direct use of the concept of potential for improvement to rank sections or
its derivative: crash frequency, crash prediction model and empirical Bayesian (EB) methods.
However, there are differences in the sections identified. Results obtained with the crash
prediction model are deemed to be more reliable than those obtained with the crash frequency
criterion as the estimate of the average crash frequency (reference population) is more
accurate. Similarly, the result obtained using EB methods is seen to be more reliable than those
obtained with the prediction model since it also improves the accuracy of the crash frequency
at a site.

While definitive conclusions cannot be derived from an example, it nevertheless illustrates how the
detection of sites may differ depending on the detection criterion used. For this reason, it is strongly
recommended to make use of more than one identification criterion and to compare the obtained results.

11. INTERVENTION SELECTION AND
PRIORITISATION

KEY MESSAGES
Once high-risk locations have been identified, appropriate interventions must be assessed
and selected to address this risk.
Prioritisation of appropriate road safety interventions requires an economic assessment,
such as the cost-benefit analysis.
Effective road infrastructure interventions are available to help address road safety
problems, regardless of the cause. These can reduce the likelihood and/or severity of a
crash. Some interventions can almost eliminate death fatalities and serious injury injuries,
while others provide more limited (or incremental) improvements.
Interventions should be designed to address risk at a specific location, routes or across the
whole road network.
Detailed information is available on effective interventions and when these should be used
implemented, including for those in useful for LMICs.
Interventions can be selected based on the expected reduction in injury injuries and
fatalities, but other factors should also be considered when selecting interventions.
Once appropriate locations have been identified, there is a need to assess which
combination of interventions and/or locations will produce the greatest reduction in fatal
and serious injuries for the budget available.
Economic assessment should be undertaken to identify the most cost-effective use of
resources. The process for this is well established, including for LMICs, and tools are
available to assist in this task, which can be implemented in the context of LMICs as well.

11.1 INTRODUCTION
Once risk locations have been identified, and relevant information analysed to identify the likely causes,
there is a need to select interventions and prioritise these for action. Figure 11.1 shows how these fit
within the Road Infrastructure Safety Management process.

FIGURE 11.1: INTERVENTION SELECTION AND PRIORITISATION WITHIN THE ROAD INFRASTRUCTURE
MANAGEMENT PROCESS

There is a cost associated with every road safety infrastructure intervention. Every country has a limited
budget available to improve road safety therefore it is important to ensure that reductions in deaths and
serious injuries are maximised within the budget available. This requires good knowledge about the
effectiveness of road safety interventions in different circumstances. It also requires a process to help
prioritise the implementation of safety treatments. Interventions are individual and collective actions that
are taken to address risk. The terms ‘countermeasures’ or ‘treatments’ are also used.

This chapter provides information on the selection and prioritisation of effective road safety engineering
interventions. It provides advice on the types of available options, and the process and tools that can be
used to decide upon the most appropriate options. Intervention options and selection are outlined in
Section 11.3 Intervention Options and Selection. In order to maximise safety outcomes, a priority ranking
method is required, and this is typically based on economic assessment. This process is described in
Section 11.4 Priority Ranking Methods and Economic Assessment. Once the priorities have been ranked,
the cut-off for implementation of schemes is necessarily governed by the available budget and the main
crash reduction target.

There are several guidelines which show some specific road safety problems and related crash types that
contribute most to death and serious injuries. Some of these are aimed at addressing problems in LMICs,
and also provide information on effective interventions. These include:

The World Health Organization (WHO) has produced a guide to addressing pedestrian safety
and crashes involving this road user group (WHO, 2013).
The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) has published guidance on addressing
motorcycle crashes in their compendium of best practice (Haworth et al., 2010). This tool is a

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 244/353



very useful source of information, including advice on effective interventions for those in LMICs
who are experiencing crashes of this type.
‘Towards Safer Roads in Developing Countries’, produced by TRL (1991) provides very useful
information targeted at those in LMICs on effective safety treatments.
The Global Road Safety Partnership (GRSP) has produced a guide on addressing speed-related
crashes (GRSP, 2023).

PIARC has produced a guide to saving lives around the world with proven countermeasure (PIARC, 2023).
The countermeasures highlighted in this guide are notable because they have proven track records of
success in multiple countries. Issues and priorities of low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) were inputs
used to determine the list of proven countermeasures.

The Global Road Safety Facility (GRSF) has developed an evidence-based guide on ‘what works and what
does not work’ in road safety in response to the critical need for effective evidence-based solutions (Turner
et al., 2021). The guide offers a range of recommendations with a focus on interventions in LMICs,
although the information may also be of relevance to all countries.

There are other documents that provide more general advice for these and other key crash types (i.e. they
are not specifically targeted at the issues in LMICs). Some of these documents are freely accessible and
provide guidance on the following issues.

research on specific topics.

Many other documents can be accessed via the Internet from a variety of sources on these and other crash
types. However, care should be taken to ensure that documents accessed from this source have been
produced by reputable agencies, and that they provide robust information. Other documents exist that
provide advice on a range of crash types and appropriate interventions in an easy-to-access format. Key
documents are listed later in this chapter.

HOW DO I GET STARTED?
The most cost-effective interventions to target key crash problems are well known. As a starting
point, these interventions should be implemented in a targeted way on high-risk routes. These
include:

Adequate driver information (markings, channelization and signage).
Nighttime lighting.
Location to safely perform enforcement activities.
Footpaths and safe crossing points for pedestrians.
Separation for the most vulnerable user, pedestrians, motorcycles and bicycles.
Adequate provision of safety for intersections (grade separation at the highest volume
locations; roundabouts; raised platforms).
Median barriers for higher volume, high speed roads.
Roadside protection for high-speed roads.
Effective speed management to reduce likely impact speeds to survivable levels.

An ideal starting point is to implement multi-sector (e.g. including policing and education
programmes) demonstration projects on high-risk corridors utilising these effective interventions. For
those just starting, this is a useful way to ‘learn by doing’ in a way that is easy to manage.

Economic assessment procedures need to be established, and key staff trained in this process. This
will help effectively prioritise limited budgets. It will also help prepare an adequate business case for
investing in road safety.

11.2 PROJECT-LEVEL AND NETWORK-LEVEL
APPROACHES
Developing network-wide assessments to guide programme development is an essential part of a
comprehensive road safety programme for a road authority. This should be based on a good
understanding of system-wide risks and issues. Project-level identification of risk that is consistent with the
higher-level network-focused programme approach is also required. Both are discussed in Chapter 10.
Assessing Potential Risks and Identifying Issues. In a similar manner, network-level approaches can be
taken to address this identified risk through effective infrastructure interventions. To address system wide
issues, wide scale implementation of treatments can be undertaken. This implementation can cover the
network, corridor, segment or spot location for differing timeframes.

Perhaps the best documented example of this approach is the implementation of the 2+1 road design
scheme in Sweden, as described in the case study below.

CASE STUDY - Sweden: 2+1 road design

It was recognised that the rural road network with a 13 m cross-section had a very poor safety
performance when compared to other road types. In 1998, the Swedish Road Administration (SRA)
commenced an innovative road safety programme with the aim of providing safe 13 m cross-section
roads in a cost-effective manner. The 13 m roads featured a single lane in each direction with wide
shoulders. The 2+1 treatment involved narrowing the shoulders to 1 m, and providing two lanes in
one direction and one lane in the other, with a narrow median and flexible (‘cable’ or ‘wire rope’)
barrier in the median. Programme evaluation revealed a 76% reduction in fatalities, with safety
performance equivalent to that of a motorway. Read More

As well as network-level implementation of specific treatments (such as the 2+1 design identified above),
frameworks can also be developed to provide guidance on the application of treatment types. As an
example, a framework has been developed in New Zealand for guiding safety investment decisions based
on the level of collective and/or individual crash risk. Figure 11.2 is inspired by this approach and
illustrates how collective and individual risk can be used to influence cost effective outcomes. Individual
risk applies to an individual road user. It is often expressed as the likelihood that a given road user will be
involved in a crash (often in crashes per vehicle kilometre travelled), which takes into account traffic
volume. Other metrics are also available. Individual risk is a useful measure for assessing the quality (in
safety terms) of road infrastructure. Collective risk refers to the total expected crash outcome for all
vehicles (e.g. crashes per kilometre) and is heavily influenced by traffic volume. Using information on
collective and individual/personal risk, the treatment types can be categorised into four groups:

Safe System transformation.
Safer corridors.
Safety management.
Safety maintenance.

FIGURE 11.2: FRAMEWORK FOR TREATMENT SELECTION ON HIGH-RISK RURAL ROADS (SOURCE: ADAPTED
FROM DURDIN & JANSSEN, 2012)

Roads with high traffic volumes have a high expected number of crashes; and those that include road
engineering features below the standards for the function, are likely to score high in both collective and
individual risk areas (the red area in Figure 11.2). Substantial investment into road safety treatments on
such roads would often be justified via Safe System Transformation works, e.g. a major upgrade; provision
of an alternative, higher quality route; freeway style interchanges, etc. Further examples of these higher
cost, but highly effective treatments can be found in Effective Safe System Interventions in Section 11.3
Intervention Options and Selection.

Roads with intermediate collective and individual risk outcomes fall into the Safer Corridors or Safety
Management categories (orange and yellow areas in Figure 11.2). For example, highways in rural areas
with moderate traffic volumes, characterised by localised and scattered severe crashes and compromised
road design, may fall in the Safe Corridors area. The most effective approach may be to improve the entire
corridor using a mix of high-cost and low-cost solutions (e.g. installation of safety barriers, and road
markings, intersection upgrades, etc.).

Safety Management ideas may apply to roads with lower traffic volumes, more scattered severe crashes
(e.g. local streets and roads) and inadequate road standards. The best economic return in terms of safety
would be achieved with network and/or corridor-level application of low-cost treatments, e.g. speed limit
revisions, line-marking treatments, or targeted asset management (e.g. pavement resurfacing with
associated safety treatments, including shoulder sealing). This group also includes roads with a high
collective severe crash risk due to high traffic volumes, but with a good overall road safety standard (e.g.
urban motorways). It is important to emphasise that in this case, infrastructure interventions are often not
cost-effective. The most cost-effective actions may be based on targeted systemic changes, e.g. managed
freeways techniques and infrastructure supported enforcement.

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 248/353



Roads with low collective and individual risk (green area in Figure 11.2) are most likely candidates for
Safety Maintenance activities. Safety Maintenance often involves incremental and systemic changes, such
as managing the road surface (and thus skid resistance), or improving signage and line-markings.

Figure 11.2 shows that as collective and individual risk increases, more extensive treatments are likely to
be applicable. As the risk progresses to higher categories, the benefits of applying the lower categories
treatment options should also be considered.

Although developed and implemented in a HIC, the approach outlined is equally useful in LMICs,
particularly for upgrading existing road infrastructure. The approach can be an effective way to help
prioritise road safety activities.

The case study from the Czech Republic provides an example of improving safety through the use of self-
explaining roads.

CASE STUDY - Czech Republic: The self-explaining performance of Czech roads

A variety of countermeasures has been proposed and continuously applied in the Czech Republic,
such as infrastructural improvements, increase of police enforcement, and improvement of traffic
safety education. Despite the efforts, annual evaluations of the National Road Safety Strategy
fulfilment show that the goals have not been met. In this critical situation, new solutions and
measures need to be adopted. An option, mentioned in the Strategy, is to improve the road network
based on the principles of self-explaining and forgiving roads. Self-explaining environment is a traffic
environment that, through its design, simply generates safe behaviour. The concept implies the
design of a road system in which drivers’ expectations created by the road environment are implicitly
in line with safe behaviour. Read more

11.3 INTERVENTION OPTIONS AND SELECTION
PRINCIPLES AND CRITERIA FOR INTERVENTION SELECTION
Once the problem type has been identified (whether through crash analysis or other forms of risk
assessment), the next step in the process involves the selection of an appropriate intervention. The main
aims during this stage are:

The identification and selection of interventions that are expected to reduce the number and/or
severity of crashes of a particular and dominant type.
To check that the selected interventions do not have undesirable consequences (in terms of
safety or otherwise).
To maximise the benefits that can be achieved with the available funding (ensuring that the
selections made are cost-effective on a number of sites).
To select interventions where the benefits outweigh the costs.
Preparation of a list of priority sites and development of action plans.

Public consultations to ensure acceptance by the community and affected road users can also be
organised.

There are a number of issues to consider when selecting interventions. Usually cost and economic
efficiency are the first and foremost considerations, but there are also others. It is important to ensure that
the intervention is cost-effective and gives a positive benefit-cost ratio, and that it can be implemented
within the available budget. Based on issues identified by Ogden (1996) and BITRE (2012), other
considerations include:

Crash reduction – will the intervention maximise crash reduction, and will the treatment deliver
the expected crash reduction at this location?
Effect on traffic – is there likely to be any effect on traffic delay and redistribution of traffic
(particularly to lower quality parts of the road network)?
Health implications – a reduction in death and serious injury is the most obvious issue, but there
may be other health implications from the selection of different treatments. For example,
certain treatments may lead to safer conditions for walking and cycling, thereby increasing
community health outcomes.
Environmental issues – for example, increased or decreased air and noise pollution, or through
removal of roadside vegetation that may have some visual appeal but be a hazard for vehicles.
Accessibility – there is a need to ensure that access is maintained for key road users, including
the elderly and disabled.
Public acceptance – whether the intervention will be accepted by the community and supported
politically, and whether non-compliance will be an issue.
Public understanding – will road users know how to use the new intervention (e.g. driving
behaviour at roundabouts)?
Feasibility – will it be possible to install the intervention at this location (including issues relating
to physical constraints, sight distance, etc.)?
Legal issues – is there legal provision for the intervention? Will users be able to continue to
conform to road laws once it is implemented?

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 250/353



Compatibility – is the intervention consistent with other strategies and measures that have
been previously implemented in similar situations?
Available staff resources – is there staff available and skilled enough to install and maintain the
intervention?
Maturity of local market – for example, are there high-performance barriers available in the
domestic market?

A ‘hierarchy of control’ is often used in risk assessment when selecting and prioritising interventions. As an
example, Marsh et al. (2012) suggest that such a hierarchy helps identify a priority order for different
types of road safety treatment based on outcomes. They suggested a road engineering hierarchy based on
the Safe System approach to help address driver distraction and fatigue. The hierarchy has four levels, and
it is suggested that level 1 is equivalent to a level of risk where Safe System outcomes are likely to occur:

Level 1: Reduce forces transmitted through ‘conflict points’ (e.g. the point of impact between
two vehicles) to within the human tolerances (particularly through speed management).
Level 2: Design self-explaining roads (this includes design to naturally cause safe road user
behaviour.
Level 3: Design forgiving roads, to provide opportunities for road users to recover from
mistakes and non-compliance.
Level 4: Design to reduce crash probability to an ‘acceptable’ level.

EFFECTIVE SAFE SYSTEM INTERVENTIONS
There are a large number of safety interventions that can be used to improve road safety. Some have only
a small impact on safety, while others can produce substantial reductions in fatalities and serious injuries.
The concept of ‘high-performing’ infrastructure was introduced in The Role of Safer Infrastructure in
Section 4.7 Safe System Elements and application, and has been discussed in the context of the Safe
System approach in several documents. For example, Turner et al. (2009) present a framework for Safe
System infrastructure solutions based on major crash types with a distinction between ‘primary’ and
‘supportive’ road safety treatments.

Primary treatments are those that have the potential to achieve Safe System outcomes or near-zero
deaths and serious injuries. This can be achieved by reducing impact forces to safe levels or by separating
different road users. A supportive road safety treatment helps to improve safety, but only incrementally.
For example, a hazard warning sign may reduce the occurrence of crashes (which can include severe
crashes), but will have no impact on the severity of a crash, should one occur.

It is strongly recommended that primary treatments are implemented where possible to reach the Safe
System objectives. ‘Primary’ or ‘Transformational’ treatments should be presented as the first option. If
these cannot be used, it is preferable to consider treatments that might represent a step forward, with
minimal redundancy of investment, to future Safe System implementation. For example, a wide central
painted median with audio-tactile lines may be installed with adequate width to allow future application of

Issues specific to LMICs regarding the use of such treatments are discussed further in Intervention
Effectiveness in LMICs.

NZTA (2011) refers to Safe System Transformation treatments for rural roads. These are defined as
treatments that are likely to address high percentages of the fatal and serious injury crashes associated
with of the three key crash types for rural roads (run-off-road, head-on and intersection crashes). It is
recognised that these treatments generally involve higher costs, and that they need to be implemented
over a longer time period. Examples of such treatments include expressways (4-laning and 2+1
treatments), median and roadside barriers, grade separation (overpasses and interchanges), roundabouts,
and effective speed management. New Zealand also provides a framework that encourages investment in
Primary or ‘Transformational’ treatments as standard safety interventions (NZTA, 2021).

The following case studies in Hungary demonstrate innovative use of primary Safe System treatments in a
temporary, or low-cost, application.

CASE STUDY – Hungary: Temporary roundabouts (primary treatment)

Hungary has demonstrated the application of temporary roundabouts to improve intersection safety.
The following three (3) examples show the low-cost application of a primary Safe System treatment
(roundabouts) that have proven effective in reducing the risk associated with turning traffic at
intersections. The first example is located in Szécsény; the second example is located in Nagyoroszi;
and the third example is located in Oroszlány - Read more

Where a primary solution is not feasible due to project constraints dictated by budget, site, conflicting road
user needs, or the environment, the next safest ‘supporting’ Safe System solution needs to be identified.
Ideally, supporting treatments should act as stepping stones towards better Safe System alignment and be
compatible with future implementation of Safe System options. In most cases, supporting treatments are
those that reduce the likelihood of a crash but do little do reduce its severity. For example, a wide
centreline will help to reduce the probability of a crash by providing greater separation between opposing
traffic flows. However, when a crash occurs, the severity of an injury is still likely to be high.

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 255/353



The case study from Germany provides an example of a supporting Safe System treatment through the
use of a painted wide centreline to support overtaking and separating opposing traffic flows.

CASE STUDY – Germany 2+1 roads with wide centreline (supporting treatment)

On German rural roads, over 200 people are killed every year due to overtaking and many people
suffer injuries, many of them serious. Roads with higher traffic importance are planned according to
design classes 1 and 2 of the Guidelines for the Design of Rural Roads from the Road and
Transportation Research Association. Design class 1 provides a standard cross-section of 15.5m, with
three lanes to enable overtaking on about 40% of the route for corridors with an AADT of approx.
12,000 - 22,000 vehicles per day. Both directions of travel are separated by a green median strip 1
meter wide. Evaluation has found that standard cross-sections of two-lane rural roads have a 17%
higher crash frequency than 2+1 cross-sections. Read more

Supporting treatments that are compatible with future implementation of Safe System options are shown

CRASH MODIFICATION FACTORS

One of the most important considerations in selecting interventions is knowledge of the safety benefit of

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 256/353



each intervention. This benefit is often described as a crash reduction factor (the expected percentage
reduction in crashes), or crash modification factor (CMF, which is the multiplier by which the crashes
before treatment are adjusted; e.g. a CMF of 0.8 indicates that there will be an expected reduction of 20%
in crashes).There are several sources that provide information on this issue (also see Box 11.1):

The Handbook of Road Safety Measures (Elvik et al., 2009): this handbook provides extensive
information on 128 road safety measures, including those relating to road design, maintenance,
traffic control, vehicles, driver training, education, enforcement and post-crash care. Some of
the interventions included in the road design and traffic control items include roundabouts,
roadside safety treatments, street lighting, speed limits, pedestrian treatments and road
markings. A rigorous approach to study selection and benefit calculation is adopted. Studies
from around the world are included, with a strong emphasis on European research.
Road Safety DSS: this online tool, developed by the European Commission funded project
SafetyCube, has been designed to enable policymakers and stakeholders to select and
implement the most appropriate strategies, measures and cost-effective approaches to reduce
casualties of all road user types and all severities in Europe and worldwide. The DSS presents a
comprehensive evaluation of a wide range of crash risks, and the effectiveness and cost-benefit
(where possible) of safety measures. The focused risks and measures evaluation is
concentrated in four main areas: road users, infrastructure and vehicles, with separate
consideration of serious injuries. Links between the risks and measures are considered across
each main area.
Effectiveness of Road Safety Engineering Treatments (Austroads, 2012): this document
provides information on crash effectiveness for 57 infrastructure safety treatment types, and
126 crash effectiveness values have been derived for them. The research basis is international,
but there is an emphasis on research from Australia and New Zealand.

BOX 11.1 CMF CLEARINGHOUSE

The Crash Modification Factor (CMF) Clearinghouse is one of the most comprehensive and advanced
sources of information on road safety infrastructure effectiveness. Funded by the US Federal Highway
Administration (FHWA), it provides a searchable database of information on infrastructure effectiveness.
It is constantly updated, meaning that it is one of the most up-to-date sources of information on this
topic. The CMF Clearinghouse applies a star rating (from one to five) according to the robustness of
each CMF. This rating was updated to be based on study design, sample size, standard error, potential
biases, and data source.

THE CRASH MODIFICATION FACTOR (CMF) CLEARINGHOUSE



Given the objective of the Safe System approach is to eliminate crash fatalities and serious injuries, it is
important to understand the effect that different interventions have on these outcomes. However, much of
the research on intervention effectiveness provides information on casualty reduction (i.e. reduction in
fatalities, serious injuries and minor injuries combined) or on change in all crashes (including non-fatal
crashes). This is an important distinction, and it is unfortunate that there is so little information on fatal
and serious outcomes. Although it is desirable to minimise all crash types, including crashes that do not
result in injuries, an overall reduction in fatal and serious injury is paramount. Safety professionals should
not discourage the implementation of interventions that have a neutral effect on minor and non-injury
crashes, and there may actually be situations where such crashes will increase (typically through a
reduction in severity of the crashes that do continue to occur at a treated location).

In the absence of information on the effect of interventions on fatal and serious crash outcomes,
information on casualty reduction should be used, although engineering judgement may also be required
when using this information. The expected reduction in fatal and serious crash outcomes is often higher
than the reduction in all casualties. As an example, BITRE (2012) found the impact on crashes from
installation of roundabouts is greater for higher severity outcomes:

Effect on property damage only: 52% reduction.
Effect on casualties: 71% reduction.
Effect on fatalities: 79% reduction.

Similar trends were seen in a European study by Jensen (2013).

The following matrix (Table 11.3) provides a basic summary of road safety treatment options and their

As can be seen from Table 11.3, speed management is a treatment that can be applied to most key crash
types. Where speed has been identified as an issue, speeds can be reduced using effective speed
management. This will result in fewer fatalities and serious injuries, provided compliance is high or
additional enforcement measures are used.

The following case studies from Puerto Rico, Portugal, Slovakia, Italy and Hungary all show examples of the
effective use of interventions to improve safety.

CASE STUDY - Puerto Rico: Crash Cushions

The highway PR-26 is a 16-kilometre expressway in the urban area of the San Juan Metropolitan Area
with a limited ROW and physical constraints, especially the exit gores at the grade separated
intersections ramps. This expressway has 12 grade separated intersections in its 16-kilometre in
length. The short distance between some of the intersections and aggressive driving of the drivers
due speeding and lane changing manoeuvres, have resulted in a high crash frequency in the gore
areas of the exit ramps. To improve the understanding of the drivers when they approach to the gore
area, the Puerto Rico Highway and Transportation Authority (PRHTA) decided to improve the safety
devices and delineation of the ramps. As part of the solution, PRHTA implemented a crash cushion
upgrade project with other safety measures in the gore area. Read more

CASE STUDY - Portugal: Coimbra: Delineation and Barriers

In 2010, it was built an urban highway to access Coimbra, the third biggest city in Portugal. However,
there is a one single point, in a section with an exit ramp, where the geometric features fail. It
features two consecutive sharp bends after a long straight alignment in a longitudinal profile with a
5% slope. The first curve is to the with about 250m of radius, and the other to the with about 500m.
In the last 6 years, this 5,5 km road section registered 33 road crashes, 3 fatalities, and 44 injuries,
and that single point registered half of the crashes, 67% of the fatalities and 40% of the injuries.

CASE STUDY - Portugal: Coimbra: I-4 expressway improvements

In 1989, it was competed the rural road IP4 between Amarante and Vila Real, crossing a mountainous
region in the north of Portugal called Serra do Marão. It was the first two-lane expressway to cross
this territory, allowing speeds between 80 and 100 km/h, with a cross section that varies between
two or three lanes, but without separate carriageways. There is a 20 km section, from Amarante to
the top of the mountain (Alto do Espinho) where the fatalities concentrate. On this section, and from
1996 to 2004, IP 4 registered 393 road crashes and 48 fatalities, in which 51% were head-on
collisions. In 2005, the Portuguese Road Administration implemented a set of measures, not only to
reduce speed, but also to reduce the number of overtakes. Read more

CASE STUDY - Slovakia: 3 star or better road upgrades

Slovakia’s road network was targeted for safety improvements to reduce fatalities and serious
injuries. NDS, Slovakia’s national motorway company, in conjunction with EuroRAP, undertook a
programme of Star Rating assessments to improve the safety standard of the motorway.
Improvements include the installation of safety barriers, rumble strips and impact attenuators and
the paving of shoulders. EuroRAP estimates that 355 deaths and serious injuries will be reduced in
the next 20 years. Read more

CASE STUDY - Italy: Speed reduction schemes on urban collector roads

The case study describes a set of safety measures in via Pistoiese (Firenze – Italy), that is an urban
collector road classified as a high crash concentration section. A detailed safety study has been
undertaken to identify the possible applicable safety measures. Crash analysis, road safety
inspections and driving simulation studies were performed. The interventions to be implemented
combines physical and perceptual treatments. Read more

CASE STUDY - Hungary: Improving pedestrian crossing visibility (supporting treatment)

The case study describes a set of safety measures to improve the visibility and perceptibility of a
pedestrian crossing in Hungary. Safety improvements included extending kerbs to provide greater
visibility of pedestrians on the footpath, improved signage and line markings and street lighting to
improve visibility during both day and night. Read more

CASE STUDY - Hungary: Safety infrastructure for motorcyclists (supporting treatment)

Following a road surface renovation on a mountainous and winding section of road in Hungary, the
road, with its excellent surface, was then used by motorcyclists as a racetrack, resulting in serious
injury crashes. Countermeasures to improve safety for motorcyclists included specially designed
warning signs and road markings as well as curve signs and safety barriers with underrun protection
for motorcycles. Read more

CASE STUDY - Hungary: Intersection traffic signals (supporting treatment)

The case study describes the installation of traffic signals to improve safety for pedestrians at the
four-way intersection of main road 8 and two rural roads (7308 and 8401) in the city of
Bakonygyepes. Read more

CASE STUDY - Hungary: Intersection enhanced warning / speed limit (supporting
treatment)

The case study describes the installation of traffic signs and line markings to improve warning at an
intersection on Hungarian rural road 8135 (characterised by poor visibility) and to reinforce the
70km/h speed limit through the intersection. Read more

CASE STUDY - Hungary: Improved skid resistance (supporting treatment)

The case study describes the application of “grooving” to an existing pavement surface on highway
M3 in Hungary to improve skid resistance. The treatment has been successful in reducing crash types
often associated with skid resistance (rear-end and loss-of-control crashes), particularly in wet
weather conditions. Read more

As can be seen from Table 11.1 speed management is a treatment that is able to address most key crash
types. Where speed has been identified as an issue, speeds can be lowered using effective speed
management. This will result in fewer fatalities and serious injuries, provided compliance is high or
additional enforcement measures are utilised.

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 263/353



SELECTING INTERVENTIONS
Interventions should be selected to fit the crash type occurring at a particular site, route or area. Crash
types can be identified through reactive (crash based) or proactive identification methods (see Assessing
Potential Risks and Identifying Issues in the Section 11.4 Priority Ranking Methods and Economic
Assessment).

Single interventions can be implemented, or more commonly, combinations of interventions can be
selected to address a particular crash type or issue. The final intervention selection requires expert
judgement about the factors that have contributed or may contribute to the occurrence of crashes.

Several guidelines provide advice on appropriate interventions to address specific crash problems. PIARC
(2023) and Turner et al. (2021) provide details of road safety countermeasures based on the Safe System
approach, which have proven to be successful in various countries. The effectiveness of each proven
countermeasure is described, including recommendations on crash reduction and strategies for
practitioners to consider in implementation. The countermeasures have also been categorised according
on how they address key Safe System principles, such as reducing severity, as well as targeting key crash
types and vulnerable road users.

PIARC (2009) provides a detailed set of options in the Catalogue of design safety problems and potential
countermeasures. Advice is provided for road function, cross-section, alignment, intersections, public and
private services, vulnerable road users, traffic Signing and marking and roadside features. PIARC published
‘The role of Road Engineering in Combatting Driver Distraction and Fatigue Road Safety Risks’ (PIARC,
2016) to highlight driver distraction and fatigue from the view of the Safe System approach. Figure 11.4
shows an example of Hierarchy Level 1 Treatments. The document outlines a hierarchy of treatments and
provides engineering solutions to address driving distraction and fatigue-related road safety risks. To
highlight the issue potential countermeasures for vulnerable road users the documents ‘Vulnerable road
users: Diagnosis of design and operational safety problems and potential countermeasures’ (PIARC, 2017)
and appendices were published.

Several interventions that address safety issues related to each of these topics are presented. Treatment
types are then presented, along with related photos, basic descriptions, indicative costs, crash types

FIGURE 11.5: TREATMENTS FOR UNFORGIVING ROADSIDES FROM THE PIARC CATALOGUE (SOURCE: PIARC,

There are several online tools that provide similar, and in some cases more detailed information. Some
cover a wide variety of treatment types, while others concentrate on particular crash types. Both FHWA
and iRAP have developed online toolkits that provide guidance on treatment options to address different
road safety issues. They are regularly updated and revised, capturing the most recent findings in road
safety. Each includes detailed information on crash problem types and treatments, including indicative
costs, safety and other benefits, implementation issues, and references.

FHWA’s Proven Safety Countermeasures initiative (PSCi) is a collection of 28 countermeasures and
strategies effective in reducing roadway fatalities and serious injuries on our Nation’s highways. These
strategies are designed for all road users and all kinds of roads—from rural to urban, from high-volume
freeways to less travelled two-lane State and county roads, from signalized crossings to horizontal curves,
and everything in between. Each countermeasure addresses at least one safety focus area – speed
management, intersections, roadway departures, or pedestrians/bicyclists – while others are crosscutting
strategies that address multiple safety focus areas.

The iRAP Road Safety Toolkit is targeted to solutions working in LMICs, and has been translated into
different languages, including Spanish, French, Russian, Portuguese and Hindi. An image from this toolkit is
shown in Figure 11.6.

FIGURE 11.6: OVERVIEW OF THE ROAD SAFETY TOOLKIT (SOURCE: TOOLKIT.IRAP.ORG)

A HUMAN FACTORS APPROACH TO DIAGNOSTIC ASSESSMENT

The approach described here is based on the work done by William Haddon, who developed the Haddon
Matrix (see Haddon, 1972, 1980). The Haddon matrix provides a tool for understanding the factors related
to human, vehicle and environmental attributes before, during, and after a crash. The goal is for safety
professionals to consider driver confusion, misperceptions, workload, distraction, and other factors.

The Haddon matrix considers three phases of a crash: 1) Pre-crash phase, which includes those factors
that influence whether a crash will occur and then result in injuries: 2) The crash event phase, which
reviews those factors that will influence crash severity during the crash event; 3) The post-crash phase,
which influence the survivability from the crash. Milton and van Schalkwyk (2022) expanded the matrix to
provide a framework that directly considers all road users (e.g., cycling and walking volumes), as well as
the supporting social safety environment, consistent with the Safe System approach, adding
considerations of the mix of users and their interactions to the Human Factors Interaction Matrix (Campbell
et al., 2018). Figure 11.7 shows the Modified-Haddon Matrix applied to motor vehicle crashes in the Safe
System.

FIGURE 11.7 MODIFIED-HADDON MATRIX APPLIED TO MOTOR VEHICLE CRASHES IN THE SAFE SYSTEM
(SOURCE: NATIONAL ACADEMIES, 2024)

Campbell points out that by introducing social environment factors, safety professionals are asked to
consider the implications of attitudes, biases and equity decision-making frameworks for humans
operating in the roadway environment. Diagnostic assessments are expanded in the effort to incorporate
this information. The assessment approach considers laws to reduce severity or frequency of crashes and
the road user's willingness to accept those laws and how each of these can be used to address potential
safety outcomes.

Equity is considered by assessing more than just vehicles, because vehicle access cannot always be taken
for granted, especially within communities that might be lower income or overburdened, and where they
cannot purchase a vehicle. In many lower income and minority communities sidewalks and lighting may
not exist, which leads to lower level of safety and security.

Road user mix is an important consideration as all road users must interact within the context and road
environment. An example is how the visibility of a pedestrian on a rainy day may be negatively affected,
thus leading to an increase in the potential for a road crash.

Although the focus of this manual is on infrastructure interventions, it is important to ensure that multi-
sector approaches (e.g. those involving education and enforcement) are considered, as these will often
have a greater impact on safety than infrastructure measures alone. This is especially the case in LMICs,
where there may be lower levels of compliance, or less understanding by the public regarding the intent of
safety interventions. Issues specific to LMICs and intervention effectiveness are discussed in Intervention
Effectiveness in LMICs, while the following case study provides an example of a combined infrastructure
and education programme to address pedestrian safety in South Africa.

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 268/353



CASE STUDY - South Africa: Capetown: Pedestrian infrastructure and road safety
education and awareness programmes

The R300 Freeway Project included the need to holistically address the mobility and accessibility
needs of all road users. The project involved the use of unconventional methods to engage
communities to take ownership of road safety responsibilities as they impact their daily travel needs.
This was done in the context of a major road infrastructure investment and ensuring that existing
road safety concerns were addressed and not inadvertently increased. In 2007, the South African
National Roads Agency Limited (SANRAL) upgraded the R300 Freeway. This entailed upgrading from
a 4-lane to a 6-lane dual carriageway freeway for additional capacity, installing concrete median
barriers to separate the carriageways, providing street lighting along the median and to the sides of
all existing interchange ramps, widening of existing on and off ramps at interchanges;, widening of
bridges along the route, and the deployment of a Freeway Management System, including CCTV
surveillance and variable message signs. The project was completed in July 2010. To facilitate safe
pedestrian access and mobility, a pedestrian bridge was also constructed. Read more

As another example, the SURE handbooks (particularly the handbook ‘Plan d’actions et realisation des
actions’ – Sétra, 2006) provide guidance on the French methods for selecting safety interventions on the
network (see Box 9.6).

INTERVENTION EFFECTIVENESS IN LMICS
Most of the information on intervention effectiveness is based on research conducted in HICs. Aside from
research on behavioural interventions in LMICs, there are very few studies on the effectiveness of road
safety infrastructure treatments in these countries. This issue is significant, as it cannot be expected that
interventions used in HICs will have the same outcomes when used in LMICs.

This issue has been highlighted in several studies. OECD (ITF, 2012) suggests that there are many
context/environment-related elements that influence actual crash reduction, and that this is a more critical
consideration in LMICs. For example, the provision of a hard shoulder might improve the safety of a road in
a HIC. However, in a lesser developed country it might encourage improper use, such as the installation of
stalls for selling items to travellers, which could decrease the overall safety of the roadway. Understanding
these issues critical to the successful implementation of safety treatments.

There also appear to be several obstacles to the successful implementation of road safety infrastructure
treatments. Turner and Smith (2013) conducted a workshop to identify issues around the implementation
of infrastructure treatments in LMICs. Several effective infrastructure treatments were discussed and
obstacles for each were explored. Although several issues were identified for each treatment type, many
of these fell into similar categories. These included cost, compliance issues, design and implementation
issues, public acceptance and maintenance.

Cost was identified as an issue for many of the treatments, although interestingly not for all. For some of
the highly effective treatments, cost does not appear to be a significant issue. Of greater interest is that
issues relating to compliance and design/implementation were identified for more of the treatments than
cost. Compliance of treatments by road users is a significant problem in LMICs, and it is very likely that the

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 269/353



treatment effectiveness will be lower as a result. Issues that were affected by this compliance problem
were:

Roundabouts (due to missing priorities, and even vehicles driving in the opposite direction).
Pedestrian crossings (failure of traffic to respect the give way).
Pedestrian footpaths (obstruction and misuse by vehicles, (including motorcycles)).
Signalised intersections (failing to stop).
Shoulder sealing (misuse as additional lane, vehicle parking, roadside trading).
Off-road cycle/motorcycle paths (obstructions on paths, misuse by inappropriate vehicles).

This issue of compliance indicates the need for a multi-sector response to the road safety issues. The use
of safer infrastructure needs to be supported by appropriate education and enforcement, as discussed
earlier in this manual.

Design and implementation issues were also found to have an impact on the effectiveness of treatments. If
a treatment is not well-designed and the installation is not of a high standard, the crash reduction potential
will not be met. This was considered an issue for all of the treatments discussed. This situation can only be
improved through increasing the skills and capacity of those working in LMICs, including the sharing of
knowledge regarding good practice.

Lastly, maintenance is also an issue that will impact on the crash reduction effectiveness of treatments. It
is common for treatments to deteriorate to levels where they become less safe (or possibly to a point
where they are higher risk than if the treatment was not present). Appropriate funding is required to
ensure that treatments are maintained over time. Training may also be required regarding the issue of
maintenance.

Although all of these issues are likely to be concerns for HICs, they are possibly more pronounced in LMICs,
and will certainly have an impact on treatment effectiveness. The extent of this effect is not known, but it
can be expected that because of these issues, treatment effectiveness is likely to be different (typically
less) than when the same treatments are used in HICs.

Given the absence of good information on treatment effectiveness in LMICs, it is recommended that crash
reduction values from HICs be used as a starting point when selecting treatments. However, the issues
discussed above need to be carefully considered, and appropriate revisions made to expected benefits. In
the longer term, it is hoped that the knowledge base regarding treatment effectiveness in LMICs will
improve, but this will only occur if appropriate monitoring, analysis and evaluation occurs in these
countries (see Chapter 12. Monitoring, Analysis and Evaluation of Road Safety). The case study from
Puerto Rico shows the effective use of rumble strips to lower roadway departure crashes.

CASE STUDY - Puerto Rico: Rumble Strips

A driver can leave the roadway for a variety of reasons, including: driving too fast, poor pavement
conditions, driver fatigue, vehicle defects, poor visibility, and others. In Puerto Rico, the number of
fatalities associated with roadway departure represents approximately 25% of the total fatalities
caused by traffic crashes. To reduce roadway departure crashes, Puerto Rico Highway and
Transportation Authority (PRHTA) decided to implement an island wide systemic project of that
involves the installation of rumble strips in the and shoulders of the freeways. This low-cost, high-

benefit improvement was installed on more than 200 kilometres of freeways in a two-year period.

INNOVATIVE SAFETY TREATMENTS
Innovative safety treatments will be required in order to help eliminate fatalities and serious injuries due to
road crashes. Many safety treatments currently result in some residual serious crash outcomes, and so
improvements to current treatments will be required. As treatments are applied to new situations
(including in LMICs) there will be a need to adapt them for better outcomes. There are also a number of
highly effective interventions that exist and are used in some countries but not at all in others. There is a
need for road agencies and supporting organisations to adopt new approaches, provided these are
implemented based on an evidence-based approach.

Some highly effective treatments are not used in some countries due to:

Lack of knowledge regarding the treatment and its effectiveness.
Lack of experience of how to implement and maintain a treatment.
Concern about legal liability in case something goes wrong.
Concern about public understanding or acceptability.
Unready local market.

When selecting new treatments, road agencies should ensure that these treatments have been rigorously
tested and have demonstrated safety benefits. Demonstration projects can be an effective way to assess
promising treatments, and prepare for a wider roll-out (see Strengthening Capacity to Set and Deliver
Targets in the Section 6.8 Demonstration Projects).

It is suggested that a methodological approach be taken towards innovation, outlined in the following
steps:

Identify the problem: Identify the target crash type, the road user type and the locations that
need to be targeted. See Chapter 10. Assessing Potential Risks and Identifying Issues for more
details on problem identification.
Identify possible solutions: This can include solutions that are used abroad, or it can be an
adaptation of an existing treatment.
Assess the solutions: It is important to research treatments thoroughly to ensure they are likely
to be beneficial for safety outcomes as well as other policy objectives. This assessment can be
based on documented experience from other road agencies. For newer treatments, driver
simulators are sometimes used to determine the likely effects. In some instances, treatments
can be implemented in a controlled environment (e.g. off-road, or in a low-speed area) to
determine the likely effects.
Trial the selected solution: A demonstration project can be an effective way to test the
treatment within a specific context and in a controlled environment. This can also help prepare
for a wider dissemination.
Monitor, analyse and evaluate the trial: Ensure that the outcomes are as expected, and that
there are no adverse effects to any road user’s safety. This evaluation should include an
assessment of the cost effectiveness of the new treatments, especially when compared to

existing option. See Section 11.4 Priority Ranking Methods and Economic Assessment for
information on economic appraisal, and Chapter 12. Monitoring, Analysis and Evaluation of
Road Safety for more information on monitoring, analysis and evaluation.
Disseminate the solution on a wider scale: It is necessary to monitor and evaluate the
treatments, including crash analysis once sufficient data has been collected. Design and
operational information in guidance documents should be included.
Inform others: If the new treatment is effective, it is important to inform others of this.
Information on treatments that have not performed well is also very important for the
international road safety community.

Several reference documents highlighted earlier in this chapter provide innovative examples of road safety
infrastructure treatments. Some agencies actively promote certain treatments (including innovative ones)
that they would like to see used more often (e.g. Proven Safety Countermeasures | FHWA (dot.gov) which
documents and promotes proven safety countermeasures, including innovative intersection design). Many
national and local studies have been undertaken to assess innovative treatments with promise. These
studies are usually undertaken by universities and research institutes. Information on these trials can be
found in international journals and at conferences, although care should be taken to ensure that such
information is robust.

The case studies below provide an example of innovative use of intelligent transport systems (ITS) in
Thailand and pedestrian and cyclist crossings at tram and transit lines in Germany.

CASE STUDY - Thailand: Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) on State Route 304

A 12.5-km section of State Route 304 that passes Tublan National Park in Thailand is notorious for
severe crashes and was identified as one of the top crash corridors by the Department of Highways
(DOH), based on 5-year crash records. It is the only remaining 2-lane section of the corridor, as most
of State Route 304 has been widened to 4-lanes. The section comprises mountainous terrain with an
average gradient of 8%. While plans for widening this section of State Route 304 are being
developed, the process is time-consuming. The Thailand Department of Highways implemented ITS
strategies and a crash Warning System as an interim measure to address the problem. Utilizing video
and microwave detection, cameras and variable message signs (VMS), data including vehicle volume
and speeds are collected and relayed to DOH Headquarters for event analysis. Read more

CASE STUDY - Germany: Pedestrian Crossings at Tram and Transit Lines

Crossings for pedestrians over tram and urban transit lines play an important role in the framework of
urban road traffic safety in Germany. The severity of crashes between rail vehicles and non-
motorized traffic at such locations is very high in most cases. In Germany, key design elements to
improve the safety of crossing points for pedestrians and cyclists at tram and light rail lines include
considerations relating to design layouts, the arrangement and placement of road signs and signals,
and technical equipment addressing people with mobility restrictions; combinations of these aspects
are also included. Read more

11.4 PRIORITY RANKING METHODS AND
ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT
The previous chapter discussed how to identify risk, while the earlier part of this chapter discussed the use
of effective interventions to address the risks that have been identified. The next important step is to
determine the priority of different treatments. In most situations, there are likely to be financial
constraints, which means that not all worthy projects or programmes can be funded. Therefore, a method
is needed to identify which projects/programmes should be undertaken as the highest priority. There are
also likely to be several options for addressing a risk, and it is necessary to see which of these options will
produce the best safety benefit per unit cost. Economic appraisals or evaluations can be used to prioritise,
compare and select road safety interventions. They help identify measures that yield the highest social
return.

At the strategic level, it may also be necessary to establish the relative importance of proactive and
reactive measures and decide on the budget proportion that will be allocated to each approach. The
guidance provided in this chapter can be used at the strategic, programme or project level.

PIARC (2012) has produced the ‘State of the practice for cost-effectiveness analysis, cost-benefit analysis
and resource allocation’ document, which provides comprehensive advice on methods to appraise projects
and allocate resources. This document defines project appraisal as an assessment of the value of a project
in order to establish whether the project meets the country’s economic and social objectives. Evaluation
approaches include cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) and cost-benefit analysis (CBA) (also referred to as
benefit-cost analysis (BCA)). The outcome indicators from this analysis (BCR, NPV, FYRR and IRR) are
discussed in Assessment Criteria. The following sections provide a summary of some of the key material on
these issues.

Economic appraisal might prove to be challenging in some cases due to the lack of information regarding
the Crash Modification Factors associated with a particular intervention or due to the difficulty in
estimating the costs of the countermeasure. However, in the cases where the economic appraisal is
possible, it provides a strong framework for the selection of the preferred countermeasures. The economic
appraisal may be done through a cost-effectiveness analysis or a cost-benefit analysis.

Cost-effectiveness analysis involves comparing the cost of a proposed countermeasure with the outcome
or effect it produces. Within cost-effectiveness, projects are ranked and screened according to their cost
and effectiveness in improving road safety or achieving policy objectives. Cost-effectiveness is mainly
applied when comparing alternative projects, programmes and policies with a similar outcome. This
method can be utilised when monetising the benefits is not possible (e.g., due to lack of information on
social costs of road crashes). The cost-effectiveness is expressed as the cost-effectiveness ratio (CER),
which is calculated by dividing the number of crashes prevented by the cost of the measure. It can be
defined as the number of crashes avoided per unit cost of implementing the measure.

Cost-benefit analysis uses monetary values to compare total benefits with total costs of any given policy,
programme or project. It is mainly used to determine the worth of an investment based on the total
benefits and costs of the investment, and to compare a project with any alternative projects. Cost-benefit
analysis is used in road safety economic appraisal to help build a business case and secure funding for
different projects or programmes. It enables comparisons between alternative road safety measures,
identifying both the cost and the benefits to society to determine if the project should be undertaken and

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 274/353



to establish priorities for approved projects. This, in turn, encourages the efficient allocation of limited
resources to competing policies. Cost-benefit analysis requires assigning an economic value to the
benefits, which can be done by determining the monetary value of the estimated crash reductions.

Yannis et al. (2008) provide a useful summary of cost-effective infrastructure interventions in an analysis
for the Conference of European Directors of Roads (CEDR). They examined 55 road infrastructure
investments, including reviews of both the costs and benefits of each. Based on this analysis, they
identified several best practice examples that should be considered in the efficient planning of
investments. The cost-effective intervention options were:

Roadside treatments (clear zones and safety barriers).
Speed limits.
Junctions layout (roundabout, realignment, staggered junctions and channelisation).
Traffic control at junctions (traffic signs and traffic signals).
Traffic calming schemes.

DATA REQUIREMENTS
The key data requirements or parameters for estimating countermeasure benefits and costs are as follows:

INITIAL COST

Initial costs refer to implementation costs (e.g. installation, material and labour costs) for each
countermeasure. The costs differ by road environment type, traffic volumes, local environment, local
labour costs, and availability of materials. There is greater uncertainty surrounding implementation costs
in most LMICs as the information is not readily available. The Road Safety Toolkit outlines general cost
levels for different countermeasures. These values can be used as indicative measures where the
treatments have not been implemented before or in cases where the cost information is not readily
available.

ANNUAL MAINTENANCE AND OPERATING COSTS

Annual maintenance and operating costs refer to routine and periodic maintenance costs and running
costs. The level and regularity of maintenance and associated operation costs depend on the
countermeasure. As an example, junctions’ layout will most probably not require frequent maintenance,
while markings and traffic signs will certainly require it.

TERMINAL SALVAGE VALUE

Some countermeasures may have a residual value if they are removed. For example, an intersection may
be temporarily equipped with traffic signals for a number of years until a bypass is completed; after
completion, the reduction in subsequent traffic flows may warrant the removal of the traffic signals. If the
countermeasure asset can be used elsewhere, the recovery of this cost should be considered. However, in
most cases, any residual value is likely to be negligible in the context of road safety countermeasures.

SERVICE/TREATMENT LIFE

A countermeasure’s service life refers to the time period over which a treatment will deliver safety benefits
before major rehabilitation or replacement is required. It varies with:

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 275/353



The type and scope of the project.
Climate conditions (which may cause infrastructure deterioration).
Traffic volumes (higher volumes might cause infrastructure deterioration, while growth in
volumes may result in the need for different infrastructure).
Local standards (more stringent construction requirements may result in slower deterioration).
Resource and materials availability (certain materials are more resistant to deterioration).
Regularity of maintenance.

For projects involving multiple treatments, e.g. intervention programmes on locations with high crash risk,
the service life applied is that of the longest-lived component. Table 11.4 gives example maximum
treatment lives for different countermeasures. Given the issues listed above, this is likely to vary
substantially for individual projects. As an example, in the US, the treatment life for line-marking is
expected to be one year, especially in States that experience snow and ice conditions.

ESTIMATE OF RESULTING CRASH CHANGES

The main benefits of road safety projects are expressed in terms of monetary savings from crash
reductions or prevention of casualties (fatalities and injuries) over a given number of years.

Treatment effectiveness can be expressed as crash modification factors (CMFs). Several comprehensive
resources that provide CMFs for different interventions are provided in Section 11.3 Intervention Options
and Selection, including the CMF Clearinghouse database and the iRAP Road Safety Toolkit. As also
discussed previously, the effectiveness and magnitude of crash changes can vary according to their
context/environment.

In cases where several treatments are applied at the same location (multiple countermeasures), estimates
of overall benefits need to be made. Some approaches have only included the crash savings from the
primary or main treatment, but it is preferable that total benefits be calculated. Care needs to be taken to
ensure that benefits are not counted more than once for interventions that improve safety in similar ways.
For example, to address crashes at a curve, interventions such as advanced warning signs, audio-tactile
edge lines, and improved road surface friction may be applied. The total benefit of these treatments will
not equal the sum of benefits for each treatment, as each is alike in terms of its effect on crashes. For
situations where treatments are linked, an adjustment needs to be made. Although several complex
approaches have been devised to calculate the total benefit from multiple treatments, the simple
approach outlined by Shen and Gan (2003) will usually suffice. They suggest a multiplicative formula
similar in form to that shown below:

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 277/353



As an example, if three countermeasures are being considered in one location, with CMFs of 0.6, 0.75 and
0.8, the results would be as follows:

CMFt = 0.6 x 0.75 x 0.8

= 0.36, or 36% of crashes will remain (i.e. a 64% reduction in crashes)

A 64% reduction in casualties is obviously less than the 85% reduction that would be calculated if each
reduction was added together.

Roberts and Turner (2007) were able to compare safety benefits at locations where packages of
treatments were used, with locations where the same treatments were used but as single treatments. By
applying the above formula, they identified that this approach tended to overestimate the true benefit of
treatments. They suggested the results be multiplied by 0.66 to provide a more conservative approach (for
the above example, this would produce a result of 42% reduction).

For a detailed discussion on the effectiveness of multiple treatment projects, see AASHTO (2025), iRAP
(2013), and Elvik (2007).

MONETARY VALUES FOR DIFFERENT CATEGORIES OF ROAD CRASHES

The benefits resulting over time from safety countermeasures are estimated by placing an economic value
on crashes and applying this to the expected reduction in crashes. Values should not be derived on a
project-by-project basis but should be set at the national level and updated annually.

This economic value, referred to as the social cost of crashes, is the value of property damage caused by
vehicle crashes, medical and ambulance costs, insurance and administration costs, loss of output costs,
police costs, and human costs associated with the pain and suffering caused by death and injury. The
different cost components are outlined in Table 11.5.

TABLE 11.5: CRASH COST COMPONENTS (SOURCE: PIARC, 2012)

Costs per casualty

Lost productivity (depending on the underlying hypothesis, gross loss of output or loss of
output net of consumption)

Human costs (loss of life expectancy, physical and mental suffering of the victim, mental
suffering of the victim’s relatives and friends)

Medical costs (medical rehabilitation)

Non-medical rehabilitation

Other economic costs.

Costs per crash

Damage to property (including environmental damage)

Administration costs

Other costs (e.g. congestion costs, vehicle rental costs).

There have been many projects and considerable debate about the best way to determine crash costs
(Hills & Jones-Lee, 1983; Alfaro et al., 1994; Jacobs, 1995), but it is now generally accepted that only two
methods should be considered – the willingness-to-pay (WTP) approach and the human capital (HC)
approach. These approaches are summarised in Table 11.6.

TABLE 11.6: HUMAN CAPITAL AND WILLINGNESS-TO-PAY APPROACHES (SOURCE: BASED ON
HILLS & JONES-LEE, 1983)

Approach Description

Measures the impact of crash fatalities and injuries on
present and future national output. The main attribute of
HC is the present value of gross earnings (before tax).
Direct costs such as vehicle costs, medical and
emergency services costs are also added to the earnings
estimate. In other cases, costs of human pain, suffering

Human capital approach and grief are also included in the value of fatalities and
(HC) injuries.

The attributes can therefore be summarised as the value
of future output loss due to casualties sustained in road
crashes and the cost of resources spent to attend to the
effects of the crashes.

The estimates under the HC approach are average values
rather than individual ones.

Measures the amount individuals are willing to pay in
Willingness-to-pay approach order to reduce the risk of death and/or injury. Estimates
(WTP) are obtained from either revealed preferences (observing

situations where individuals trade-off wealth or income for
risk of death or injury) and stated preferences (individuals
indicate how much they are willing to pay in order to
reduce risk of death or injury based on hypothetical
situations or questions).

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 279/353



For a detailed description and discussion of the HC and WTP approaches, see PIARC (2012), HEATCO
(2006), TRL (1995), and ADB (2005). Although both approaches are widely used, the willingness-to-pay
(WTP) assessment method is generally recommended (DaCoTA, 2012; Harmon et al., 2018; McMahon &
Dahdah, 2008).

Costs must be determined for crashes of varying levels of severity, usually fatal, serious, slight or minor,
and property damage only. These severity levels can be defined as follows:

A fatal crash results in the death of at least one person within 30 days of the crash.
A serious crash does not result in any death, but at least one person has a severe injury such as
fracture, internal injury, severe lacerations, etc. and must therefore be hospitalised.
A minor crash does not result in any death or serious injury, but at least one person has a minor
injury such as a cut, sprain or bruise.
A property damage-only crash does not result in any injury or fatality, but damage to vehicles
or property is sustained.

For the purpose of prioritising actions aimed at reducing crash frequency, a single average cost for all
injury crashes is generally considered sufficient, particularly since it is difficult to predict the specific
severities of crashes that might be prevented.

Costs are always based on average values, and in some countries, are also determined for broad road
categories (e.g. urban, rural, freeway). The social cost of crashes provides an estimate of the economic
burden that different crash and injury types place on the economy. For illustrative purposes, an example of
costs by road category and crash severity for the UK in 2012 is shown in Table 11.7. These costs are
updated annually and reported in the latest version of the report ‘Road Casualties Great Britain’ in Table
RAS4001.

Costs increase from built-up roads to non-built-up roads to freeways, indicating the effect of greater
speeds on crash severity levels. It can also be seen that there are approximately ten-fold increases in
costs between severity levels. That is, the cost of a slight crash is about ten times that of a property
damage-only crash, a serious crash is about ten times that of a slight crash, and a fatal crash is about ten
times that of a serious crash.

Calculation of crash costs is generally undertaken at the country level, and the development of an
accurate figure can be a complex process regardless of which method is used. If no figure is available at
the country level, a simple method for obtaining the value of crashes, especially in the absence of the data
required for the HC and WTP approaches, is the iRAP ‘rule of thumb’ (McMahon & Dahdah, 2008). This
method uses the information from countries that have already carried out WTP calculations, and analyses
the relationship between the value of statistical life (VSL) and gross domestic product (GDP) per capita.

The recommendations for the economic appraisal model are to use (McMahon & Dahdah, 2008):

A default value for statistical life of 70 times the GDP per capita (current price), with a range
between 60 and 80 for sensitivity analysis.
A default ratio of 10 serious injuries per fatality, with a range between 8 and 12 for sensitivity
analysis.
A default value of serious injury equivalent to 25% of the value of statistical life, with a range
between 20% and 30% for sensitivity analysis.

The approach was originally developed using WTP values from a limited number of LMICs. These values
were recently updated using a larger dataset (Milligan et al., 2014). The update showed that the rule of
thumb tends to underestimate VSL for countries with GDP per capita above $7000 (Milligan et al., 2014).

Generation of crash costs can be a significant issue in LMICs, even with the availability of crash cost
estimates, or when using the ‘rule of thumb’. Due to low GDP per capita in many countries, the crash costs
can be low, while the cost of installing engineering treatments can remain high. The example (Box 11.2)
below illustrates this issue using an example from Papua New Guinea.

BOX 11.2: POTENTIAL CRASH REDUCTIONS AND SAVINGS FROM IMPROVED ROAD MAINTENANCE IN PAPUA
NEW GUINEA

In a study of the economic costs and benefits of alternative maintenance policies for the Highlands
Highway in Papua New Guinea, comparisons were made between the highly responsive approach
adopted in the Key Roads for Growth Maintenance Project (KRGMP) strategy, which was applied over
the period 2006–2009, and alternative policies.

When compared with a ‘base option’ that involved minimum surface repairs only and had an almost six-
month delay in response between the emergence of serious pavement defects and their repair; the
combined NRRSP/KRGMP inputs, if continued over a twenty-year period, could deliver economic benefits
of approximately K1.15 billion (approximately US$0.5 billion) with a marginal BCR of approximately 5,
excluding crash cost savings. This resulted from prompt pavement repairs, with a monthly cycle of

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 281/353



reactive surface maintenance, drainage and shoulder maintenance, and periodic resurfacing, and
localised pavement repairs. Where the base option was changed to incorporate pavement
strengthening or reconstruction when conditions were seriously deteriorated, the net benefits declined
to between approximately K87 million and K629 million, with a maximum marginal BCR of 4.6.

Crash rates were also investigated and revealed a potential for reduction in crash risk by up to 30%
from the current figures of approximately 4,000 casualties per year. This reduction was based on an
assumed 15% reduction due to improved road surface condition, and a combination of factors such as
improved visibility and shoulder conditions.

The total cost of crashes is given by the number of crashes of each type, multiplied by their unit cost of
crashes. On this basis, the total cost of crashes is K24.4 million annually. To place this in proportion, it is
equivalent to approaching a 2% reduction in all other costs; i.e. crash reductions will boost the cost
saving due to improved maintenance by up to 2%.

The above figures are clearly impacted by the value of statistical life applied, noting that the value used
is considerably less (by a factor of 42) than that applied in Australia. Furthermore, the relative crash
rate for the Highlands Highway is approximately four times the base crash rate of typical Australian
roads with similar operating conditions (McLean, 2001; Turner et al., 2009), which is not unexpected.

Consequently, the estimated gross crash costs are approximately 10% of those calculated for similar
conditions in Australia. This is likely to have significant consequences for the economic justification of
crash mitigation measures and warrants closer study.

Aspects that require consideration include: a) the value of statistical life, with the possibility that
current ‘lost output’ methods take insufficient account of the extended family who are often supported
by a ‘bread-winner’ in traditional societies in PNG and elsewhere. The loss of income has potential to
affect the education and income-earning opportunities of a generation ; b) the need to account for real
increases in income growth in LMICs, and the consequent increase in ‘real’ crash costs; c) the challenge
of identifying affordable engineering treatments to mitigate crash risks, noting that the actual cost of
road treatments delivered in LMICs and HICs are almost comparable (probably a maximum of 2 to 3
times different), whereas the value placed on the social cost of crashes is some 40 times less.

Alternatively, the value of different injury severities can be derived using Quality Adjusted Life Years
(QALYs) and Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs). QALYs measure the value of a fatality prevented,
taking into account the quantity and quality of life. They place a weight of one for a year of perfect health
and zero for death. DALYs on the other hand, measure the quality of life lost or loss of life years due to
illness or injury. They account for the burden of injury or illness and can also be used to measure property
damage. DALYs and QALYs are widely used in health economics and very rarely in road safety. An example
application of DALYs and QALYs in Colombia road safety is outlined in Box 11.3.

BOX 11.3 ESTIMATING THE COST OF CRASHES IN COLOMBIA

In estimating the cost of crashes in Colombia, Bhalla et al. (2013) applied the willingness to pay and the
value of statistical life years methods. This involved estimating the incidence/occurrence and severity of
injuries due to road crashes.

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 282/353



Using the well-established relationship between the value of statistical life and GDP per capita, they
used different rules of thumb to estimate the cost of crashes using DALY estimates. These rules are
outlined below.

RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN VSL AND GDP CAPITAL (SOURCE: BHALLA ET AL., 2013)

The unit costs used in the estimation are outlined below.

RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN VSL AND GDP CAPITAL LOSSES (SOURCE: BHALLA ET AL., 2013)

DISCOUNT RATE USED FOR SCHEMES

In any economic road project assessment, it is important to identify a base year from which all future costs
and benefits can be assessed. This is because the value of a dollar received in the future is less than the
value of a dollar now (also referred to as the ‘time value of money’). The discount rate is used to compare
benefits and costs received at different points in time over a project’s treatment life, converting future
benefits and costs to present values.

The choice of discount rate can have significant effects on the desirability and selection of projects,
especially where benefits and costs accrue later in the treatment’s life. A higher discount rate reduces the

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 283/353



value of benefits and costs occurring later in the treatment’s life, favouring projects where benefits occur
early in the project. The World Bank recommends present value calculations at 12% discount rates (2014
values) be included in road project business case submissions (see PIARC, 2012; AASHTO, 2025). It is
important to note, however, that this value is not necessarily relevant for every country, and the discount
rate actually used can be significantly different. For instance, the discount rate is close to 5% in several
western European countries.

ASSESSMENT CRITERIA
As indicated above, the standard approach for the ranking of treatments is to carry out a cost-benefit
analysis, i.e. to compare the estimated benefits of each scheme (in terms of the value of crashes that will
be prevented) in relation to its costs (implementation, maintenance, etc.). The treatments are then
prioritised in accordance with the best economic returns.

As previously mentioned, estimating likely crash reductions resulting from remedial work is often difficult,
because it can only be based on previous experience with similar schemes (Turner & Hall, 1994; Kulmala,
1994; Mackie, 1997).

The selection of countermeasure options is based on the first year rate of return (FYRR), the internal rate
of return (IRR), the benefit-cost ratio (BCR), and the incremental benefit-cost ratio (IBCR), as well as net
present value (NPV). The NPV is only used for complex projects, the FYRR is instead a fast method for
comparing small projects. These measures indicate whether the benefits of the proposed treatment
outweigh the costs, and if the preferred treatment has the greatest net social benefit.

It is worth pointing out that it is easy to have good indices with low-cost interventions, even if they save
few lives. For this reason, the effectiveness of interventions in terms of the absolute number of crashes
avoided should also be taken into account in the evaluation, and those with negligible effects should be
excluded.

FIRST YEAR RATE OF RETURN (FYRR)

This is simply the net monetary value of savings and drawbacks anticipated in the first year of the scheme,
expressed as a percentage of the total capital cost. The formula for calculating the FYRR is as follows:

where:

benefits = (crash savings in monetary terms) + (change in maintenance costs) + (change in journey costs)

Note that the last two elements of the benefits estimation might be considered to be small, particularly for
low-cost schemes, and are often ignored.

This is not a rigorous evaluation criterion for prioritisation since it ignores any benefits or changes in
maintenance costs after the first year. However, it is very simple to calculate, and given that road safety
engineering schemes often produce first year rates of return in excess of 100%, more sophisticated
decision criteria may not be necessary. This method usually yields high values with low-cost schemes but
with relatively small crash savings, and for this reason it is less consistent with the Safe System approach.

The FYRR can also be used to assess the timing of a particular project by comparing it with the discount
rate. If the FYRR is greater than the discount rate, the project can, in theory, proceed. This says nothing,
however, of how it compares with other projects. If the FYRR is less than the discount rate, the project
should, at the very least, be postponed.

More detailed assessments will be needed for schemes where crashes and traffic levels are expected to
change substantially from year to year. For example, a scheme with an 80% FYRR may not be worthwhile
if subsequent road closures due to the construction of a new road limit the benefit to just one year.

Example – First year rate of return (FYRR)

Example: a country has produced the road crash cost breakdown shown in Table 11.7. The average
cost per crash is generally higher than the cost per casualty because, on average, there is more than
one casualty in each crash. The average cost of an injury crash for 2023 has been calculated to be
$125,790.

Now consider an intersection that had 12 injury crashes in 3 years, 9 of which involved - angle
collisions with drivers overshooting the stop line - this being the treatable group of crashes. Let us
assume from past experience that the installation of a roundabout is likely to prevent two- thirds of
these collisions. If the target FYRR for all schemes to be undertaken in the year in question has been
set at 50%, then the maximum budget for the scheme may be calculated as:

In other words, the scheme should not cost more than $505, 674 in order to achieve a 50% rate of
return.

In the above example, the First Year Rate of Return has been used to determine the maximum cost of
the scheme if a 50% rate of return is to be achieved. If the scheme did in fact cost $200,000, then
the First Year Rate of Return would be more than 50% (actually 79%). This method could then be
used to rank alternative schemes in order of their First Year Rate of Return.

Note: FYRR greater than 100% are need to make schemes economically viable

INTERNAL RATE OF RETURN (IRR)

Another important criterion used for assessing costs and benefits of highway schemes is the internal rate
of return (IRR). This is the discount rate that makes the NPV equal to zero or makes the BCR equal to one.
A theoretical example of how the discount rate affects the NPV of a project is shown in Figure 11.8.

FIGURE 11.8: AN EXAMPLE OF THE INFLUENCE OF DISCOUNT RATE ON NPV

At discount rates of 8% or 10%, the project has a positive NPV, while it is negative at 12% or 14%. The NPV
is zero at 11% discount rate, which is known as the internal rate of return (IRR). The IRR is preferred by
multilateral aid agencies, such as the World Bank, because it avoids the use of local discount rates which,
depending on their value, can significantly affect the NPV or NPV/PVC ratio.

The IRR provides a guideline to evaluate if a particular project or investment should be pursued. If the IRR
is greater than the minimum required rate of return or hurdle rate (normally the cost of capital), then the
project or investment can be worth pursuing as it is expected to generate returns greater than the cost of
financing it. If the IRR is equal to the hurdle rate, the project is expected to break even with returns
equivalent to the cost of capital. On the contrary, if the IRR is lower than the hurdle rate, then it is
recommended to reject the project or investment, as the expected returns would be less than the costs of
financing.

The internal rate of return (IRR) is useful to determine the profitability and attractiveness of a particular
investment. Among different alternatives, the one with the highest IRR is preferable, provided that it is
above the hurdle rate. The IRR can be used along other metrics such as the NPV to form a holistic view of
the viability of a certain road safety project or investment.

BENEFIT-COST RATIO (BCR) AND INCREMENTAL BENEFIT-COST RATIO (IBCR)

Benefit cost ratio (BCR) is defined as the present value of benefits (PVB) divided by the present value of
costs (PVC):

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 286/353



When the NPV of any given project is positive, the BCR is greater than one. The greater the BCR, the
higher the benefits are. The BCR is used to rank projects where there is a budget constraint, and it serves
as an indicator of a project’s economic efficiency.

The IBCR involves ranking a pairwise comparison of all alternatives with a BCR greater than one in order to
determine the marginal benefit obtained for a marginal increment in cost. Then, after eliminating all
schemes with a BCR of less than one, the schemes are listed in order of ascending cost and the marginal
BCR is determined by a pairwise comparison of alternatives, starting with the lowest and second-lowest
cost alternatives. That is:

where:

x and x+1 = the lowest and next to lowest cost alternatives

n = service life of the scheme

i = discount rate

x / x+1 =alternative x compared to alternative x+1

If the IBCR is greater than one, the alternative x+1 is preferred, since the marginal benefit is greater than
the marginal cost. Conversely, if the IBCR is less than one, alternative x is preferred. The preferred option
is then taken and the pairwise comparison is continued until only a single alternative remains, which
should then be the most economically desirable of all the options considered.

NET PRESENT VALUE (NPV)

This type of evaluation expresses the difference between discounted costs and benefits of a scheme,
which may extend over a number of years. As stated earlier, future benefits must be adjusted or
discounted before being summed to obtain a present value. Changes may also take place over the life of
the scheme which will affect benefits in future years.

Let us assume (for ease of calculation) that the current rate used by the government for highway schemes
is 10%, which in the prevailing economic climate might be considered as somewhat high in most countries.
This means that $100 in benefits accruing this year will be worth 10% less if it accrues next year. A further
year's delay will reduce the benefit again, and so on. These figures can be summed over the life of the
scheme to obtain the present value of benefits (PVB).

The equation below is used to calculate discount factors and resulting factors are shown in Appendix 11.1:

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 287/353



where:

r = discount rate

n = number of years

Net Present Value (NPV) is defined as the difference between the discounted monetary value of all the
benefits and costs of a particular project or measure. The NPV is expressed as the PVB minus the PVC. A
positive NPV indicates an improvement in economic efficiency compared with the base case.

With respect to implementation priorities, the economic criteria for scheme assessment using the NPV
approach are:

All schemes with a positive NPV are worthwhile in economic terms.
For a particular site, the most worthwhile option is the one with the highest NPV.

Care needs to be taken in using NPV as the only investment criterion, since it tends to indicate projects
with higher costs.

Example – NPV assessment

Let us assume that the anticipated initial cost of redesigning an intersection will be $200,000 spread
out equally over two years, with annual maintenance costs over the next 5 years (the life of the
scheme) of $8,000. Assume the discount rate to be 10%.

As noted above, the benefits are always difficult to estimate and will often require an educated
guess. In this example, let us assume, based on previous experience in similar circumstances, that 10
injury crashes over the first two years (5 per year) will be saved, and that this will drop to 3 per year
afterwards due to changes in traffic. If the average cost of an injury crash is $125,790, as shown in
Table 11.7, the total savings would amount to $628 950 in each of the first two years, followed by
$377,370 in each of the remaining 3 years. The Net Present Value is calculated in Table 11.8 to be
$1,478,313.

Net Present Value (NPV): +1,478,313

In other words, in this particular project (discounted) benefits exceed costs by more than $1,400,000.
The project certainly appears to be worthwhile.

If the estimated benefits do not vary throughout the scheme, the calculation of NPV is simplified by
the use of cumulated discount values, which are shown for various discount percentages in Table
11.A2. For example, if the same benefit is repeated over a 5 year period and the discount rate is
10%, the cumulative discount rate is 3.79. Assuming that the value of the annual benefits is $50,000,
the total net benefit is then:

In the above example, the First Year Rate of Return has been used to determine the maximum cost of
the scheme if a 50% rate of return is to be achieved. If the scheme did in fact cost $200,000, then
the First Year Rate of Return would be more than 50% (actually 79%). This method could then be
used to rank alternative schemes in order of their First Year Rate of Return.

NPV can be calculated with the Economic Assessment Calculator.

Example

Table 11.9 shows an example of a remedial works priority program ranked in terms of the scheme’s
NPV/PVC ratio for a 5-year period.

In this example, the NPV/PVC’s site ranking is similar to the FYRR’s ranking, but somewhat different

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 289/353



from the one produced by the NPV.

Using this listing, a line can be drawn for a particular budget. Let us assume in this case a budget
limit of $500,000. The full list of 10 sites could be implemented only with a budget of $683,700. The
line indicating where the budget run out is usually described as the ‘cut-off’ rate.

This calculation can also be made with the Economic assessment calculator.

RECOMMENDED APPROACH TO PRIORITISATION

The choice of assessment criteria depends primarily on available data, as well as the scope of the
treatment. The different assessment criteria provide information on the project. The NPV provides
information on the total welfare gain over a project’s treatment life; the BCR highlights the relationship
between the present value benefits and implementation costs of a project; while the IRR shows the rates
at which benefits are realised after investing in a countermeasure (PIARC, 2012).

The NPV is the preferred criterion as it provides an estimate of the absolute size of the treatment’s net

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 290/353



social benefit. The BCR on the other hand provides the relative size of the costs and benefits of a
treatment and depends on the classification of the project’s impacts. Table 11.10 provides guidance on
when to use the different criteria.

TABLE 11.10: DECISION CRITERIA (SOURCE: AUSTROADS, 2005)

However, Ogden (1996) concludes that the BCR approach is more cumbersome to use than the NPV
approach and may produce more ambiguous and misleading results depending on how benefits and costs
are defined. It is of particular note that low-cost measures are typically favoured when using BCR as the
basis for selection. For example, installing advanced warning signs are likely to have a limited (but
beneficial) effect on severe crash outcomes, but due to the low cost of installation, they are likely to
produce a high BCR. In contrast, roadside barriers are likely (in the situation) to have a significant effect on
reducing fatal and serious crash outcomes. However, given the greater cost for installation and
maintenance, the BCR is likely to be lower. The aim of road safety is to produce a net reduction in fatal and
serious injury injuries. Using solely the BCR approach may produce outcomes that are inconsistent with
this objective. Therefore, the NPV/PVC approach in association with BCR is much preferred.

For a comprehensive step-by-step approach on economic appraisals or evaluation, as well as a
summarised discussion of the assessment criteria, see PIARC (2012) and HEATCO (2006). Box 11.3
provides an example economic evaluation from Belize.

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 291/353



BOX 11.4: BELIZE – ECONOMIC EVALUATION

In earlier chapters, information on a demonstration corridor approach in Belize was presented. This
project was developed through the production and assessment of various ‘bank ready’ investment
options. The three options were generated using a Road Assessment Programme process. This uses
various assumptions. The economic benefit from the fatalities and injuries avoided is calculated using
the methodology developed by McMahon and Dahdah (2008). The approach estimates the economic
value of a statistical life at 70 times the gross domestic product per capita at current prices, and the
economic value of a serious injury at 25% of the value of a fatality. The ratio of serious injuries to
fatalities is estimated to be 10:1. Assumptions are also made on the expected reductions from different
combinations of treatments. A summary of the three investment options generated are provided in the
table below.

SUMMARY OF THE THREE INVESTMENT OPTIONS OF A ROAD ASSESSMENT PROGRAMME

The development of several options as in this example is fairly typical for road safety projects. This will
help determine which combination of treatments will deliver the greatest benefit for the available
funding. In this case, and following discussions with the project stakeholders, the options were adjusted
with a lower cost option selected, and the benefits and costs recalculated. The estimated NPV of the
project, using very conservative crash cost values, is US$6.1 m and the economic rate of return (ERR) is
28.8%. The ERR is well-above the Caribbean Development Bank’s cut-off rate of 12.0%

It should be emphasized that the priority listing obtained by using one of the above criteria is not ‘the
perfect answer’ and other factors may come into play which affect the selection and ranking of those sites

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 292/353



that should be treated. However, a well-grounded scheme appraisal may help to prevent emotional
pressures from using up scarce resources without any other consideration. For example, if an authority is
being pressured politically or otherwise to treat a site that is off this list or below the cut-off level, the table
can be used to point out that resources should be focused on sites with the greatest potential benefits.
This is, after all, more likely to yield the best contribution to the nation’s casualty-reduction targets.

In some cases, a site may be at a location included in a major capital works program, such as a flyover or
traffic signal installation. If the implementation schedule for the program is fairly close, it may be best to
‘do nothing’ at this stage and incorporate the project into the major scheme. However, if the program is
unlikely to be carried out within 2 or 3 years, short-term (perhaps lower cost) measures are probably
justified.

For this and other reasons (e.g. seasonal weather preventing certain road works) that may lead to
‘slippage’ in timetables, it is always worthwhile to investigate more sites and to prepare more schemes
than can be carried out in the current budget period to allow for these minor re-allocations of funds.

It is important to appreciate that the assessment of sites for treatment should be a continuous process. For
example, schemes not selected for immediate implementation, either because of a low or negative NPV or
because of budget constraints, should be re-evaluated at a future date if there is reason to believe the
situation has changed. An increase in crashes at a site would make a scheme with a negative NPV more
attractive. Other changes may also occur, such as an increase in traffic volumes, etc.

What can be stated is that investment in low-cost engineering improvements at high-risk sites can yield
extremely high rates of return. For example, for general highway improvement projects, such as road re-
surfacing or realignment, FYRR of 20-30% can be considered to be reasonably high, indicating projects well
worth undertaking. However, low-cost improvements at high-risk sites can often produce FYRR well in
excess of 100%. A significant proportion of a national road safety budget should therefore be allocated to
engineering improvement projects of specific sites, along corridors or within specific areas. Such an
investment is likely to pay for itself many times over within the life of the project.

ECONOMIC APPRAISAL TOOLS
A variety of tools assist with the economic appraisal process in road safety. Some examples are provided
below.

SAFETY

AASHTOWare Safety is a Software as a Service (SaaS) platform designed to support transportation
agencies in highway traffic safety management. The platform ingests, cleanses, and combines data for
analysis. Its integrated Safety Data Warehouse stores relevant data and presents it in a user-friendly
format to facilitate searching.

The Highway Safety Manual (AASHTO, 2025) outlines six steps in the Roadway Highway Safety
Management Process: 1) Network Screening, 2) Diagnosis, 3) Countermeasure Selection, 4) Economic
Appraisal, 5) Project Prioritization, and 6) Safety Effectiveness Evaluation. By facilitating data unification
and manipulation, the Safety platform aims to provide automated insights to support agency decision-
making in these areas.

COBALT (COST AND BENEFIT TO ACCIDENTS – LIGHT TOUCH)

COBALT (DfT, 2021) is an economic appraisal tool first developed in 2012 by the UK Department for
Transport. It was derived from the broader transport appraisal tool, COBA (Cost Benefit Analysis tool).
COBALT assesses the safety aspects of road schemes using detailed inputs for either: (a) separate road
links and road junctions that would be impacted by the scheme; or (b) the equivalent links and junctions
treated as single combined ‘link-junction’ pairs. The assessment is based on a comparison of crashes by
severity and associated costs across an identified network in the ‘Without-Scheme’ and ‘With-Scheme’
scenarios. The comparison uses the details of link and junction characteristics, relevant accident rates and
costs and forecast traffic volumes by link and junction (DfT, 2024).

ECONOMIC EVALUATION MANUAL, NEW ZEALAND

While New Zealand does not have a dedicated road safety economic appraisal tool, the Economic
Evaluation Manual (EEM) (NZTA, 2013a) provides clear guidance and templates that can be used in the
evaluation process. The EEM is a guidance tool outlining procedures for economic evaluations of transport
investment proposals. It provides descriptions of basic concepts in economic evaluations and simple and
detailed procedures for evaluations. The simple procedures are aimed at low-cost activities while the
detailed procedures are for large-scale evaluations. Step-by-step methodologies for evaluating benefits
and costs are also provided through downloadable spreadsheets.

There are different spreadsheets for different evaluations. The road safety promotion spreadsheet contains
six procedural worksheets and four other worksheets for working notes, cost estimates and sensitivity
analysis. Worksheet 1 is a summary of general project information and data used for the evaluation.
Worksheet 2 is used for calculating the present value of project costs, worksheet 3 is used for calculating
the social cost of crashes per person and worksheet 4 is used for calculating the present value of project
benefits. Worksheet 5 is used to calculate the BCR per head. The cover worksheet is a summary of all the
information and calculations in the spreadsheet. For each of the steps, there is guidance offered on the
necessary information and input data.

OTHER TOOLS

European guidance on economic appraisals and prioritisation of road safety countermeasures is also
available to practitioners. Examples of this include the European Road Safety Observatory (ERSO), and the
EU projects HEATCO (Harmonised European Approaches for Transport Costing and Project Assessment)
and ROSEBUD (Road Safety and Environmental Benefit-Cost and Cost-Effectiveness Analysis for Use in
Decision-Making).

The process applied by iRAP (see Road Assessment for Safety Infrastructure in Section 10.4 Proactive
Identification) not only identifies problems and effective interventions, it also produces detailed business
plans, including the cost-effectiveness of the interventions identified. An example from the Ukraine of one
such investment plan is provided in Figure 11.9.

11.5 PATHWAY TO EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION
SELECTION AND PRIORITISATION

GETTING STARTED
Identify and use proven infrastructure interventions to address fatal and serious
casualties. Make information on these interventions available to key staff, and train these
staff in the selection, installation, operation and maintenance of effective safety
interventions.
Implement multi-sector demonstration projects on key high-risk corridors utilising these
effective interventions. Engage with key stakeholders in designing and implementing
these.
Establish economic assessment procedures, and train key staff in this process. Use these
procedures to prioritise interventions on demonstration corridors.

MAKING PROGRESS
Adapt international guidance on effective infrastructure intervention to local country use.
This can be achieved through demonstration projects.
Train road agency staff and key stakeholders in the selection, installation, operation and
maintenance of effective interventions. This should include those responsible for national,
regional and local roads.
Continue to roll out demonstration projects on high-risk corridors using effective
interventions, and extend these to all high-risk parts of the road network.
Develop economic assessment procedures and values, including crash costs, based on
local conditions and international good practice. Use this information to help maximise
efficiency when implementing interventions.

CONSOLIDATING ACTIVITY
Continually improve knowledge on effective infrastructure interventions and develop new
interventions through trials. Share new knowledge with key stakeholders and the
international road safety community.
Continue to train road agency staff and key stakeholders in the selection, installation,
operation and maintenance of effective interventions.
Continue to implement effective interventions on all high-risk parts of the road network.
Internationally benchmark economic assessment procedures and values, including crash
costs, and continually improve these. Ensure that this knowledge drives investment
decisions when implementing safety improvements.

12. MONITORING, ANALYSIS AND EVALUATION OF
ROAD SAFETY INTERVENTIONS

KEY MESSAGES
Monitoring, analysis and evaluation are often overlooked, but are essential for the
effective management of road safety.
Monitoring refers to the systematic collection of data regarding the performance of a road
safety programme or intervention during or after its implementation. Analysis involves the
study of data in order to interpret it and its parts, such as determining the contributing
factors to crashes. Evaluation involves the analysis of this data to determine the effect of
the treatment or program, or to compare locations.
There is a requirement to constantly monitor progress against road safety targets
(intermediate and outcome).
There is also a need to monitor, analyse and evaluate the effectiveness of infrastructure
interventions. There are currently many gaps in knowledge regarding the effectiveness of
interventions, especially in LMICs.
Techniques and tools are available to help in this important task.

12.1 INTRODUCTION
The final step of the risk assessment process is the monitoring, analysis and evaluation of interventions
(Figure 12.1).

FIGURE 12.1: MONITORING AND EVALUATION WITHIN THE RISK ASSESSMENT PROCESS

As described in Chapter 3. The Road Safety Management System, monitoring, analysis and evaluation is
the ‘systematic and ongoing measurement of road safety outputs and outcomes (intermediate and final),
and the evaluation of interventions to achieve the desired focus on results’ (GRSF, 2009). These tasks are
often overlooked but are essential for the effective management of road safety.

Earlier chapters have provided information on the role of monitoring, analysis and evaluation in road
safety management, including its importance as part of road safety targets and programmes (Chapter 3.
The Road Safety Management System, and to a lesser extent, Chapter 6. Road Safety Targets, Investment
Strategies Plans and Projects and Chapter 8. Design for Road User Characteristics and Compliance); and
the role it plays in data requirements (Section 5.2 Identifying Data Requirements). This chapter
concentrates on the evaluation process at the network and project level and includes information on the
importance of this process as well as how to undertake monitoring and evaluation.

Monitoring refers to the systematic collection of data regarding the performance of a road safety
programme or intervention during or after its implementation. Analysis involves the study of data to
interpret it and its parts, such as determining the contributing factors to crashes. Evaluation involves the
study of the results of the analysis of this data to determine the effect of the treatment or programme.

The purpose of the monitoring and evaluation process is to:

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 305/353



Identify and measure any changes that have occurred in crash frequency or severity and
determine whether the objectives of the safety programme or project have been reached.
Identify any unwanted or unexpected effects that have occurred as a result of the
implementation.
Establish the public’s stance on the new implementation and whether any concerns have been
raised.
Evaluate whether the intervention has had an impact on intermediate measures (such as traffic
distributions or speeds).

Performance indicators (KPIs or SPIs) can play a critical role in implementing the Safe System approach to
road safety. They delve into the causes of crashes and help track progress, enabling process-oriented
interventions that address various road-safety issues and reduce road users’ risk of death or serious injury.

Developing performance indicators involves identifying and prioritising policy areas, selecting relevant
indicators, continuously monitoring and evaluating progress, and aligning selected indicators with national
road safety strategies. Regular monitoring, realistic target setting, and the flexibility to update and
introduce new indicators are crucial.

A successful evaluation process requires careful planning at the outset, which includes collecting baseline
data, identifying the aims before implementation, and considering the different methods of analysis that
could be used for the evaluation. It is also essential that the results and feedback of the evaluation study
are properly circulated amongst stakeholders and other interested agencies.

CASE STUDY – Using Safety Performance Indicators to Improve Road Safety - The case of
Korea

Over the last decade, Korea has reduced road fatalities by roughly 50%. Various Korean ministries
and agencies are actively working to improve road safety. They have set ambitious targets to reduce
road fatalities further, focusing on vulnerable groups.

This report emphasises the importance of using safety performance indicators to complement
traditional statistics and current road safety strategies for a more comprehensive understanding of
road safety. While the report identifies indicators that may be appropriate in the Korean context, its
findings will be relevant for other countries looking to deploy safety performance indicators in the
future.

The report’s findings emphasise the critical role of adequate road safety data and standardised
methodologies in developing safety performance indicators for road safety management. Specifically,
any data used in developing and maintaining indicators should be available, accessible, trustworthy,
comparable, stable, simple, and aligned with safety objectives.

Road-safety policies and programmes should have mechanisms for collecting evidence to feed into
the policy formulation process. Long-term thinking is also encouraged, with the need to set ambitious
but feasible goals. Integrating performance indicators into national road safety strategies and
periodically reviewing and redefining these strategies is essential for long-term and sustained road
safety improvements.

There are three main types of evaluation. One or more may be appropriate for a study, and this is
dependent on the aims of what needs to be evaluated. The three main types of evaluation are:

Process or ‘formative’ evaluation: assesses whether the programme or project was carried out as planned.
This will help to identify strengths and weaknesses of an implementation process, and how it can be
improved for future usage.

Outcome evaluation: assesses the degree to which the programme has created change and whether the
programme has met its objectives. If the programme has not met its objectives, were there negative or no
impacts recorded or observed?

Impact evaluation: is a form of an outcome evaluation and assesses whether the intervention (whether a
single treatment or a integrated program) has brought about the intended change. This type of
assessment is typically more scientifically rigorous and commonly looks at cause and effect relationships.
This form of evaluation should consider aspects beyond the aim of the treatment or programme, and also
consider any potential negative or unexpected impacts that may have occurred as a result of
implementation. This can highlight changes that may be required in the design of a treatment, in the
target audience selection, or in the delivery method of a programme.

Quantitative studies produce more rigorous outputs through the use of controlled trials or before-and-after
studies.

Both qualitative and quantitative methods can be used for an evaluation study. Qualitative questions are
more useful in process and outcome evaluations in the form of focus groups, or open-answer
questionnaires, and can be insightful as to why an intervention may not have been successful.

As identified in Section 11.4 Priority Ranking Methods and Economic Assessment, information on
intervention effectiveness is also important in assessing the likely benefits of safety improvements. The
evaluation process is important for improving knowledge regarding the effectiveness of different road
safety interventions in different types of environments. However, agencies must be cautious about
generalising the results of an evaluation. The use of such information in the selection and prioritisation of
interventions is discussed in Chapter 11. Intervention Selection and Prioritisation, while this chapter
concentrates on methods for monitoring and evaluation.

HOW DO I GET STARTED?
Processes should be established for the collection of relevant data. For those just getting started, this
collection could be undertaken as part of a corridor or area demonstration project.

Staff and financial resources need to be provided for monitoring, analysis and evaluation, and key
road agency staff and stakeholders should be trained in basic analysis and evaluation methods.

Consideration should be given at the outset to the storage and maintenance of the data over time
and how it will be used.

Establish how success will be measured and what information is needed at the outset.

12.2 THE IMPORTANCE OF MONITORING,
ANALYSING AND EVALUATING
With limited budgets, it is very important to demonstrate that road safety interventions are effective, and
of value. This is particularly important in LMICs where comprehensive action plans have been developed
fairly recently with limited funds from central governments and aid agencies. and all road safety activities
must therefore be monitored to ensure that investments are effective. As each initiative is implemented,
the effectiveness of that measure should be monitored, ideally by analysing collision data during specific
‘before’ and ‘after’ periods.

Action plans should set quantifiable targets for numbers (or rates) of crashes and casualties to enable
assessment of programme effectiveness. In addition to monitoring numbers of crashes and casualties, a
newly established action plan should, possibly under the auspices of a National Road Safety Council (or
equivalent), seek to ensure that progress is actually being maintained, in other words, that the various
agencies and government departments concerned are actually implementing the improvements outlined
in the plan.

Good information is required on the effectiveness of interventions to ensure that limited available funding
is spent in the most effective way. There is currently a large gap in the understanding of how different
interventions improve safety, especially in LMICs. Intervention Effectiveness in LMICs in Section 11.3
Intervention Options and Selection highlights some of the difficulties in using information from HICs on
treatment effectiveness in LMICs. An evidence-based approach is required to improve knowledge on
effectiveness of interventions in LMICs, and this can only occur through monitoring and evaluation of
interventions in these countries.

From an overall perspective, it is important to identify the impact of a national road safety action plan and
to monitor the achievement of any goals that have been set.

CASE STUDY – UK National Safety Target Monitoring

In the 1980s, Great Britain set a national target: by the year 2000, casualties would be reduced by
one-third from the average annual values prevailing from 1981 to 1985.

Since then, national statistics have been carefully monitored in order to determine the impact of a
wide range of remedial measures, including physical improvements, changes in legislation, etc. The
overall effects are summarized in the table below.

SEVERITY 1981-85
AVERAGE 1999 PERCENTAGE

FATAL 5,598 3,423 – 39.0

SERIOUS 74,534 39,122 – 47.5

AVERAGE 1999 PERCENTAGE

CHANGE

SLIGHT 241,787 277,765 + 15.0

TOTAL 321,919 320,310 – 0.5

CHANGES IN CASUALTIES – GREAT BRITAIN

The table shows that there have been significant reductions in fatal and serious casualties but an
increase in slightly injured. What appears to have taken place in Britain over the last 15 years or so is
a very noticeable reduction in the severity of injuries, with little change in the total number of
casualties. More detailed analyses indicate changes on roads of different categories and between
classes of road users. They also reveal that traffic has increased by over 50% since 1981-85 and that
the overall casualty rate (casualties per million vehicle kilometres) has decreased by 37%.



NOTE: Since this success UK has abandoned national targets and in the most recent 10 years (2010
-2020) national figures have fallen by much less!

Even worse than the inefficient use of limited funding is the possible use of interventions that lead to an
increase in crash risk. Unfortunately, this situation does occur in public policy decision making, including
those regarding road safety, often as the result of poor information, as a result of behavioural adaptation
from road users, or from a poor implementation process. It may also occur due to trade-offs in decision
making, whereby safety considerations are not given as high a priority as other issues (such as mobility).

Studies on Crash Modification Factors (CMFs) have shown that implementing a specific intervention can
sometimes lead to an increase in the overall number of crashes. This can occur when a countermeasure
reduces one type of crash but simultaneously increases another. A common example is the installation of
traffic signals, which may decrease the occurrence of angle crashes (generally associated with higher
severity) while increasing the frequency of rear-end crashes (typically less severe). Information on CMFs
can be found, for instance, in the CMF Clearinghouse.

Monitoring, analysis and evaluation is an important component of infrastructure safety management, it
need not be undertaken to the same extent for each project. For example, if a safety intervention is
implemented in a particular locality that has already been thoroughly evaluated and deemed beneficial,
then the requirement for further evaluation may be more limited. Safety treatments that have had little or
no use in the locality will need to follow a more thorough evaluation process.

12.3 EVALUATING ROAD SAFETY TARGETS,
INCLUDING INTERMEDIATE TARGETS
Chapter 6. Road Safety Targets, Investment Strategies Plans and Projects described the process required
to set quantifiable road safety targets as part of policy development and plans. As discussed in that
chapter, there is a requirement to constantly monitor and analyse progress against these targets.

Specific programs have been developed in various countries to do this, with each part of the action plan
being provided with a clear objective, required outputs, and a series of performance indicators for each
output. Road safety objectives can thus be assessed in terms of progress being made towards a minimum
desired level of activity in that sector. This idealized framework then provides a ‘scoring frame of
reference’ against which actual performance can be evaluated.

For example, an action to plan to deliver effective road safety education should include all activities
related to road safety education and publicity. Figure 12.2 shows what may be taken to be the component
parts of this activity: the minimum outputs and the performance indicators. Progress relating to education
and publicity can be assessed on a regular basis by referring to this figure.

FIGURE 12.2: ROAD SAFETY EDUCATION AND PUBLICITY - POSSIBLE FRAMEWORK FOR EFFECTIVENESS
EVALUATION

As well as monitoring long- term targets, there is also a need to ensure that relevant agencies and
government departments are implementing the improvements outlined in the plan through monitoring of
intermediate targets. As an example, the State of Washington in the United States, previously used the
Holt Method (an extended simple exponential smoothing to allow the forecasting of data with a trend) to
forecast data trends to set near term targets and to set intermediate targets for the strategic highway
safety plan. The figure below shows a visual representation. The standard deviation is shown to report a
range of what can be expected in the near-term. Also see: Chapter 5. Effective Management and Use of
Safety Data.

FIGURE 12.3: SETTING INTERMEDIATE TARGETS IN WASHINGTON STATE, USA (SOW, 2010)

Such monitoring can also help establish whether these activities are having the desired effect on safety
outcomes. In many cases, this monitoring will identify adjustments that can be made to help improve
safety outcomes. Data requirements for these activities have been outlined in Chapter 5. Effective
Management and Use of Safety Data.

The following section provides guidance on how to analyse and evaluate road safety infrastructure
interventions. Some of these approaches can be used to help evaluate performance against targets.
However, evaluating the success of interventions in meeting targets can be a more complex task because
there are often many changes taking place simultaneously. Solutions to this issue include the evaluation of
‘packages’ of treatments (i.e. determine the effect of the combined activities that are related), or the
application of statistical modelling to try to determine the impact of individual measures. Whichever
approach is taken, the creation of a strong data collection and analysis process is required to ensure that
adequate data is collected. This will include the need for data on final outcomes (crash data) and
intermediate measures (safety performance indicators, e.g. various behavioural measures, attitude survey
information, and infrastructure measures). For further information on data requirements see Chapter 5.
Effective Management and Use of Safety Data.

For further information on the evaluation of non infrastructure interventions, there are a number of
important reference documents. These include the UK Evaluation Hub, a website and toolkit on evaluation
of education, training and publicity programmes, as well as global good practice documents on helmets
(WHO, 2023) and drink driving (GRSP, 2022), speed (GRSP, 2023 and Turner et al., 2024), seatbelts and
child restraints (FIA, 2022), two and three-wheeler safety (WHO, 2022), road safety legislation (WHO,
2013).

The Czech Republic case study shows an example of setting and monitoring targets for the countries
efforts to reduce number of people killed and injured on its roadways.

CASE STUDY - Czech Republic: National road safety strategy

With 130 persons killed in road traffic per 1 million inhabitants in 2001, the Czech Republic ranked
15th out of the 27 EU countries. Given this unacceptable situation and following principles of Vision

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 313/353



Zero and Safe System, as well as European safety policies, National Road Safety Strategy was
developed by CDV – Transport Research Centre, which is the only scientific research institute under
the Ministry of Transport. The strategic objective of the Strategy 2011 – 2020 is to reduce by 2020
the number of persons killed in road traffic to the average level of European countries and in parallel
to reduce by 40% the number of seriously injured. In annual terms, this objective translates to yearly
reductions of fatalities by 5.5%. As of 2015 the fatality reduction has not been achieved, but serious
injuries are on track. Read more

12.4 EVALUATING ROAD SAFETY
INFRASTRUCTURE INTERVENTIONS
Effective decisions regarding the use of road safety infrastructure interventions can only be made with
adequate knowledge regarding its effectiveness. The key measure that is used for this assessment is the
expected reduction in crashes, expressed as a crash modification factor (CMF) for the intervention. This
indicates the degree to which the intervention is expected to reduce crashes. CMFs are also described in
detail in Effective Safe System Interventions in Section 11.3. Intervention Options and Selection. CMFs help
policy- makers in the decision-making process, and the results from previous studies are typically used to
provide a realistic estimate of the expected effect (SafetyCube and CMF Clearinghouse). However, there
are many gaps in knowledge regarding the effectiveness of interventions.

An international collaboration on effective evaluation for road safety infrastructure interventions has been
completed in 2012 by the OECD (Sharing Road Safety - ITF, 2012) which provided the following key
messages:

Road safety policy is increasingly dependent on robust indicators on the effectiveness of
interventions. This information is required to justify expenditure, and also to argue for support
of interventions that may not always be popular. CMFs are fundamental in this context.
Lack of reliable knowledge of the effectiveness of certain road safety infrastructure is a key
barrier to the adoption of potentially life-saving interventions.
We are currently at a turning point, as there is the prospect of rapid advances and major cost
savings through the international transfer of results on treatment effectiveness (e.g. via CMFs).
Transferability of CMFs relies on analysing the extent to which a CMF is dependent on the
circumstances/context/environment in which it was developed (also see Chapter 11
Intervention Selection and Prioritization on this issue of context).
Variability in CMF research results is a major barrier to transferability between countries, but
this can be addressed by using standard approaches to evaluation, including appropriate
methodologies and reporting of the circumstances under which the intervention was used
(guidelines for developing and applying CMFs were published in the NCHRP research report 991
– National Academies, 2022).
An additional difficulty is related to the evaluation of CMFs when implementing several
interventions combined together.

Some of the key recommendations from this work were that:

Road safety policies should undergo performance and efficiency evaluation. This work cannot
be undertaken without CMFs.
Research to develop CMFs should follow the guidance presented in the OECD report (ITF, 2012)
report and provide information on essential reporting elements.
Coordination of research across countries on top priority countermeasures should be considered
within an international group.
A trans-national database is needed for CMFs to help share information.
A concerted effort should be made to publicise the benefits of decision-making based on CMFs.

The ultimate measure of the success of a road safety policy or intervention is the effect that it has had on

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 315/353



crash reduction, particularly the reduction in fatal and serious injuries. Unfortunately, difficulty arises in
considering crashes on their own, as it may be necessary to wait several years after the countermeasure
or package of measures has been introduced to be able to validate the changes in crash statistics. Given
an indication of effectiveness is often required in a shorter timeframe, particularly to determine that
nothing has gone wrong, more immediate feedback may be required. Proxy measures for safety might be
useful to monitor the effectiveness of schemes (see also Section 5.2. Identifying Data Requirements) for
the link between intermediate and final outcome measures. These proxy measures are usually
observational-type measurements. It is often recommended to conduct an evaluation in two stages: a
short-term phase (e.g. 6 months) and a longer-term phase (e.g. 3 to 5 years).

OBSERVATIONS
Where practical, the treated site, route or area should be observed immediately after completion of the
construction work, with regular visits made in the following days, weeks or months after completion until
the team is satisfied that the scheme is operating as expected.

It is recommended that any earlier behavioural measurements made at the investigation stage be
repeated later (e.g. traffic conflict counts, speed measurements, etc.), as this will help determine/support
the need for any further changes, or may in fact prove the success of the intervention. This behavioural
study is also required because some features of an intervention may, for instance, produce an unforeseen
reaction in road users and subsequently create a potentially hazardous situation. Monitoring and analysis
should highlight this problem at an early stage so that appropriate action can be taken quickly to remove
this hazard.

At best, it may be possible to alleviate this hazard easily, e.g. by realigning the kerb lines to prevent a
hazardous manoeuvre. At worst, it could lead to the complete withdrawal of a scheme and the need to
reassess alternative schemes.

Some of the issues that may be relevant to assess include:

Speeds.
Traffic conflict studies.
Traffic volumes.
Travel time/delay.
Compliance with traffic control devices.
Skid resistance.
Sight distance.
Vulnerable road user safety (nature and importance of users’ movements).

It would be impractical to carry out detailed behavioural studies for all minor alterations, but such studies
may be particularly important for expensive schemes such as area-wide or mass action treatments.

Specific studies on pedestrian movements should also be undertaken if the collision records show that a
high proportion of crashes that involve pedestrians. Similarly, a high incidence of skidding under wet road
conditions may indicate the need for specific studies on skid resistance (also associated at times with the
use of limestone aggregate). In developing countries where road user behaviour is often poor, studies on
driver behaviour at signals, pedestrian crossings, and uncontrolled intersections may also be worthwhile.

It may be preferable to allow the scheme to operate for about two months before conducting a behavioural
‘after’ study. This should serve as a ‘settling-in’ period, during which regular users get used to a new road
feature and any learning effects have largely disappeared. The evaluation should verify the impacts in
terms of safety for all users. The overall effects of a project should be understood as a whole. For example,
the implementation of a bike lane can be dangerous if used by motorcyclists.

The nature of the identified crash problems at the site should guide the choice of studies to be conducted.
Table 12.1 provides indications in this respect.

TABLE 12.1: STUDIES THAT MAY BE APPROPRIATE FOR PARTICULAR CRASH PROBLEMS

TRAFFIC SPEED

Speeding is frequently reported as being a major contributing factor in crashes, and there can be no
disputing the fact that speeding reduces safety margins and the likelihood of escaping injury. If speed
reduction is one of the objectives of the scheme, then speeds should obviously be monitored. Similar and
appropriate locations should be carefully chosen for the before and after studies, preferably using
automatic equipment.

The Technical study - Spot Speed describes how to measure speeds.

A Student t-Test can be used to determine whether any changes in the measured mean speeds between

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 317/353



two measurement periods are statistically significant or, indeed, whether there is a significant difference
between the speeds of different vehicle types (e.g. passenger cars and trucks). Changes in the actual
distribution of speeds following introduction of a speed-reducing measure can be tested with the
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.

>> CALCULATOR: SPOT SPEED STUDY

>> CALCULATOR: DISTRIBUTION TEST

TRAFFIC CONFLICTS

The collection of accurate traffic data is important when comparing crash sites. The traffic data needs to
be compatible with the crash data (e.g. for the same period) and in sufficient detail to be appropriate for
the particular evaluation. If a countermeasure is expected to affect manoeuvres at an intersection or
drivers’ choice of route in any other way, then traffic flow data should be collected throughout the local
network before and after introducing the measure.

The number of vehicles and pedestrians passing through a site will provide useful information on the
exposure to risk of the various road user groups. If, for example, significant proportions of cyclists and
corresponding crash types have prompted the introduction of segregated cycle lanes, it will be important
to monitor how well these are being used and whether they have attracted new cycle traffic.

The Technical study - Traffic Count describes how to conduct this study.

TRAVEL TIMES

In some cases, monitoring may require an estimate of changes in travel time for residents and through
traffic by carrying out ‘origin and destination’ travel time studies. This will be important where traffic
severance forms part of the scheme, and traffic is being re-routed. In economic evaluations (Chapter 7), if
the extra time lost due to re-routing is likely to be significant, then value-of-time considerations should be
taken into account (as a disbenefit).

The Technical study – Travel Time and Delay describes how to conduct this type of analysis.

PUBLIC PERCEPTION

Often one of the main reasons for implementing an area-wide scheme is that residents may have
campaigned strongly for something to be done. One of the most important parts of an area-wide scheme,
therefore, is public consultation. Thus, one factor to monitor is how the residents and other road users feel
about the safety elements of the scheme.

Ideally, public attitudes should be assessed before a scheme is implemented by posting questionnaires on
social media or sending them by email conducting interviews with residents and interviewing road users in
the treatment area. The public should, of course, be informed about the details of a proposed scheme, as
well as its necessity and suitability, before its implementation. A similar survey should then be conducted
several months after the scheme has been installed to monitor general and specific satisfaction (or
dissatisfaction).

EFFECTS ON ADJACENT AREAS

Some schemes can affect adjacent areas, possibly leading to an increase in traffic speeds, volumes and

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 318/353



crashes. Thus, it is important to monitor these factors carefully in all relevant areas adjacent to the road(s)
where the scheme was introduced.

The following six case study from Malaysia, Puerto Rico, Portugal, Slovakia and Italy provides a number of
excellent evaluations on the safety effects of various treatment.

CASE STUDY - Malaysia: Safety effects of central hatching on four lane rural roads

Based on the results of a road safety assessment along the Federal Route 1 in Malaysia, two single
carriageway sections in the state of Perak were identified to have high risk of head-on collisions. Site
observations revealed high prevalence of illegal overtaking and poor lane discipline. Installing central
hatching was identified as one viable option to provide greater separation between opposing traffic
as well as to reduce traffic speed. Central hatching (also commonly known as a painted or flush
median) is one of the perceptual countermeasures to speeding. Read more

CASE STUDY - Puerto Rico: Crash Cushions

The highway PR-26 is a 16-kilometer expressway in the urban area of the San Juan Metropolitan Area
with a limited ROW and physical constraints, especially the exit gores at the grade separated
intersections ramps. This expressway has 12 grade separated intersections in the 16-kilometer span.
The short distance between some of the intersections and aggressive driving of our drivers due
speeding and lane changing manoeuvres have resulted in high crash frequency in the gore areas of
the exit ramps. To improve the understanding of the drivers when they approach to the gore area,
the Puerto Rico Highway and Transportation Authority (PRHTA) decided to improve the safety devices
and delineation of the ramps. As part of the solution, PRHTA implemented a crash cushion upgrade
project with other safety measures in the gore area. Read more

CASE STUDY - Portugal: Coimbra: Delineation and Barriers

In 2010 it was built an urban highway to access Coimbra, the third biggest city in Portugal. However,
there is a one single point, in a section with an exit ramp, where the geometric characteristics
reduces. It has with two consecutive tight curves after a long straight alignment in a longitudinal
profile with a 5% slope. The first curve is to the with about 250m of radius, and the other to the with
about 500m. In the last 6 years, 33 road crashes, 3 fatalities, and 44 injured occurred along this 5,5
km road section, and that single point registered half of the crashes, 67% of the fatalities and 40% of
the injured. Read more

CASE STUDY - Portugal: Coimbra: IP-4 expressway improvements

In 1989 it was competed the rural road IP4 between Amarante and Vila Real, crossing a mountainous
region in the north of Portugal called Serra do Marão. It was the first two-lane expressway to tear this
territory, allowing speeds between 80 to 100 km/h, with a cross section that varied between two
lanes, or three lanes, but with no separate carriageways. There was a 20 km section, from Amarante
to the top of the mountain (Alto do Espinho) where the fatalities concentrate. On this section, and
from 1996 to 2004, IP 4 registered 393 road crashes and 48 fatalities, in which 51% were head-on
collisions. In 2005, the Portuguese Road Administration implemented a set of measure, not only to
reduce speed, but also to reduce the number of overtaking. Read more

CASE STUDY - Slovakia: 3 star or better road upgrades

Slovakia’s road network was targeted for safety improvements to reduce fatalities and serious
injuries across the network. NDS, Slovakia’s national motorway company, in conjunction with
EuroRAP undertook a programme of Star Rating assessments and works to improve the safety
standard of the motorway. Among the improvements are installation of safety barrier, paving of
shoulders, rumble strips and impact attenuators. EuroRAP estimates that 355 deaths and serious
injuries will be reduced in the next 20 years. Read more

CASE STUDY - Italy: Speed reduction schemes on urban collector roads

The case study describes a set of safety countermeasures in via Pistoiese (Firenze – Italy), that is an
urban collector road classified as a high crash concentration section. A detailed safety study has been
undertaken to identify the possible applicable safety countermeasures. Crash analysis, road safety
inspections and driving simulation studies were performed. The intervention to be implemented
combines physical and perceptual treatments. Read more

CRASH-BASED EVALUATION
The most important form of evaluation of any safety measure is determining its effect on crashes, and
whether the intervention has reduced the number of crashes (particularly fatal and serious injury ones) by
the expected amount. Evaluation involves the analysis of crash data by comparing the safety performance
before a change was made to the safety performance afterwards. This often involves statistical analysis.

To be reasonably sure that the random nature of crashes has been taken into account, it will normally be
necessary to wait for several years for sufficient and statistically significant results to be available to
conduct reliable before/after crash analyses. It is therefore essential to complement the use of such
before/after crash analyses with appropriate technical studies and site observations (shorter-term
monitoring methods) that provide useful information on a treatment effectiveness soon after its
implementation (spot speed study, traffic conflict study, etc.).

Apart from the time-scale issue, there are other factors that complicate the (apparently straightforward)
process of assessing the effectiveness of crash changes at treated sites, routes or areas. The main ones to
consider are:

Regression to the mean.
Changes at the site that are not related to the intervention (including general changes to crash
trends, changes in traffic volume, etc.).
Crash migration.

Each of these is discussed after the evaluation methods.

EVALUATION METHODS

In evaluating a particular treatment, the answers to the following questions will usually be required:

has the treatment been effective?
if so, how effective has it been?

The rare and random nature of road crashes can lead to fairly large fluctuations in frequencies at a site
from year to year, even though there has been no change in the underlying safety level. This extra
variability makes the effect of the treatment more difficult to detect, but a test of statistical significance
can be used to determine whether the observed change in crash frequency is likely to have occurred by
chance or not.

There are several key documents that provide detailed accounts of evaluation methods for road safety
infrastructure. These include:

The Highway Safety Manual (AASHTO, 2025).
An Introductory Guide for Evaluating Effectiveness of Road Safety Treatments (Austroads,
2012).
Guide to Developing Quality Crash Modification Factors (Gross et al., 2010).
Guide for Road Safety Interventions: Evidence on What Works and What Does Not Work (Turner
et al., 2020).
Guidelines for the Development and Application of Crash Modification Factors (National
Academies, 2022).

One or more of these documents should be consulted for a full account of how to conduct a road safety
evaluation.

When evaluating changes in crashes, other factors not affected by the treatment, and which might also
influence that measure, have to be taken into account. Examples include a change in the speed limit on
roads that include the site; national or local road safety campaigns; traffic management schemes that
might affect volumes of traffic: e.g. closure of an intersection near the site, producing a marked change in
traffic patterns.

These features can be taken into account by using control site data, but in order for this to be valid, it is
important that these other sites experience exactly the same changes as the site under evaluation.

The ‘gold standard’ in evaluation methodology is a ‘controlled experiment’ or Randomised Control Trial
(RCT). As indicated earlier, this approach is very rare in evaluation of infrastructure interventions. This is
mainly due to concerns with leaving high risk sites untreated, but is also due to issues such as lack of
knowledge regarding this approach. By randomly allocating sites to a treatment or control group, any
biases which arise from treating sites with the worst crash history should be eliminated. External factors
which come into play as the evaluation proceeds (such as unforeseen enforcement programmes in the
area of the trials) are also catered for, as the external factors can be assumed to affect the treatment and
control sites equally. The difference between the treatment and control sites in the after period is a true
reflection of the influence of the treatment.

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 322/353



The currently recommended approach for evaluation of infrastructure interventions is the Empirical Bayes
(or EB) method (for more details see Empirical Bayesian Methods in Section 10.3 Crash-based
Identification (‘Reactive’ Approaches)). Hauer (1997) explains this procedure in its simplest form, which is
recommended reading for those wishing to understand the logic behind this approach as it applies to road
safety. The approach uses the concept of an ‘expected’ number of crashes, or the long-term average,
calculated over as long a period as is considered useful. The second concept is the ‘reference population’,
or a set of similar sites or routes for which date is available (e.g. all intersections of a certain type in a
network). The reference population acts like a comparison group. In the classical version of EB, the number
of crashes which would be expected at a treatment site if no intervention had taken place is estimated and
compared with the number of crashes that actually occurred. The comparison of the actual number of
crashes with the expected number of crashes indicates the extent of the CMF.

Control Sites

Another method commonly applied for the evaluation of infrastructure safety is the before-and-after study
utilising a comparison group. Even though this approach does not fully address the issue of regression to
the mean, it does limit the impact of external factors. The approach compares the outcomes at the
treatment sites with the outcomes at a set of comparison sites (sometimes termed ‘control sites’), which
have similar characteristics to the treatment sites in all important aspects, except that the treatment is not
installed. This approach assumes that external factors act on both the treatment sites and the comparison
sites in an identical way, and so can be measured and allowed for. Since the treatment sites and the
comparison sites are subject to the same sets of external variables, any difference in safety outcomes
must be due to the treatment.

Changes related to external factors may be compensated for by comparing the site under study, for the
same before and after periods, with ‘control sites’ that have not been treated. Control data can be
collected either by matched pairs or area controls.

Although the matched pair is the best statistical method, in practice it may be difficult to find other sites
with similar safety problems that will be untreated purely for the sake of statistical tests. Area controls
comprising a large number of sites are, therefore, much more frequently used.

When choosing sites for control groups:

they should be as similar as possible to treated sites.
they should not be affected by the treatment.
the control area should be as large as is reasonable: as a guide, try to find a similar area or
group of roads that have more than 10 times the number of accidents than the treated sites
have.

For example, if the traffic signals at a site are to be modified, the engineer could choose all the other
signalized intersections in town as the control group. If, however, there are only two other signalized
intersections, and these had lower flows and much fewer crashes than others uncontrolled intersections, it
would be better to use, for example, all signalized intersections in the state/county.

The most basic form of evaluation (and one that has often been applied) is to simply compare crashes in
the period before an intervention is installed with the crashes after (termed a simple or naïve before-and-
after study – i.e. without a comparison group). This approach is not recommended, as it does not
adequately account for regression to the mean or external variables.

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 323/353



Cross-sectional studies have also been used to try and identify the effects of safety interventions. These
studies compare safety performance of sites with a particular safety feature (or features) with sites that do
not have the same feature. It is assumed that the difference in safety performance is due to this feature.
There are many issues with using this approach (particularly differences between sites other than the
feature of interest, and higher crash rates that may have led to the installation of the feature in the first
place), therefore it should not be used for this type of evaluation (however, if it is used, the limitations
should be well-understood and documented).

The main problem with using crash data for evaluation (even assuming high recording accuracy) is
distinguishing between changes due to the treatment and changes due to other sources. Even if the
selected sites are good comparison groups that take into account the environmental influences, there are
other confounding factors that need to be considered.

There are a number of points to take into account when choosing time periods used to compare crashes
occurring before and after treatment. These include:

The construction period should be omitted from the study. If this period was not recorded
precisely, a longer period containing the installation period should be excluded.
The before period should be long enough to provide a good statistical estimate of the true
safety level (to eliminate random fluctuations as much as possible). It should not, however,
include periods during which the site had different characteristics. As a general rule, three to
five years is widely regarded as a reasonable period.
The same rule applies to the after period, which should be at least three years. However,
results are often required much sooner than this. A one-year after period can initially be used if
there is no reason why this should bias the result (as long as the same period is used at the
comparison sites). However, sensitivity is lost, and the estimate of the intervention’s success
should be updated later when more data becomes available.

Clearly, this section of the manual cannot deal with the complex principles underlying the various
statistical tests that can be used in crash investigations and for this the reader should refer to standard
manuals on the subject. However it does cover, albeit briefly, various statistical tests that can be used to
answer the key questions posed at the beginning of this section, i.e. has the treatment been effective and,
if so, how effective has it been?

For this purpose, it is sufficient to assume that the before and after accidents are drawn from a normal (or
Gaussian) distribution. In other words, the distribution of accidents in a sample is symmetrically drawn
from either side of a mean value.

This means that we can use the ‘Chi-square’ test to answer the first question as to whether the remedial
action has been effective, i.e. whether the collision changes at the site are statistically significant. If the
same type of remedial treatment has been carried out at many sites, an additional calculation is required
in order to determine the overall effect.

Appendix 12.1 presents a brief description of some of the main statistical tests associated with transport
project evaluation. Table 12.2 provides a list of these tests and their condition of use.

TEST DESCRIPTION

STUDENT (t-TEST) Used to determine whether the mean of one set of
measurements is significantly different from another set.

KOLMOGOROV - SMIRNOV This ‘two-tailed’ test determines whether two independent
samples have been drawn from the same population (or
from populations with the same distribution).

k-TEST This calculation is used to show how a number of events at
a particular site (crashes for example), has changed relative
to a set of control data.

CHI-SQUARE This calculation used to determine whether a given change
(in crash for example) was produced by a given treatment
or whether the change may have occurred by chance.

As identified throughout this chapter, there are a number of documents that provide a detailed guide to
evaluating intervention effectiveness. There are also various tools to help with this task. An estimate of the
effectiveness of treatments in terms of percentage of potential casualty reduction is also provided by the
iRAP Toolkit.

BOX 12.1 SAFETY ANALYST COUNTERMEASURE EVALUATION TOOL

Developed by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO), the
Countermeasure evaluation tool is part of the SafetyAnalyst suite of tools. It provides step-by-step
guidance for conducting evaluation of the benefits of safety interventions using the Empirical Bayes
approach. Therefore, it is able to account for the effect of regression to the mean (see above). As well
as detecting the overall change in crashes (the CMF), the tool can also identify the effect on specific
target crash types. For further details see Harwood et al. (2010) or
http://www.safetyanalyst.org/evaltool.htm.

REGRESSION TO THE MEAN

This effect complicates evaluations at high-crash locations. Crash locations for treatment are typically
chosen because they were the scene of numerous crashes. In some cases, the high crash numbers may be
the result of just one particularly bad year, and this may have happened purely by chance.

Crash numbers at such sites will tend to fall in the next year even if no intervention is applied. Even if a
three-year period is used, crash occurrence may be due to random fluctuations, and in subsequent years
these sites will experience lower numbers. This is known as regression to the mean. According to different
international studies (an example is in Box12.1), it is believed that the regression to the mean effect can
overstate the effectiveness of a treatment by 5% to 30%. Figure 12.4 shows a graphical representation of
regression to the mean.

FIGURE 12.4: GRAPH SHOWING REGRESSION TO THE MEAN



BOX 12. 2 EXAMPLE OF REGRESSION TO THE MEAN

Mountain et al. (1998) provide a clear example of regression to the mean that can result in
overestimation of intervention effectiveness. In a large study covering over 900 sites and 13,612
crashes, they compared crashes occurring during the site identification ‘before’ period, the lag period
(the period between a site being selected for treatment and the actual installation of the treatment),
and the ‘after’ period. The crash numbers were adjusted to take the different period lengths into
account, and the data is summarised in Table 12.3. The difference between the number of crashes
occurring in the lag period and the number of crashes occurring in the before period was taken as a
measure of the regression to the mean effect.

The most robust way of accounting for both the regression to the mean effect and changes in the
environment may be through the use of control sites that have been chosen in exactly the same way as
the treated sites and have been identified as having similar problems, but have been untreated. The
choice as to whether a site is treated or is untreated is based on a random allocation. This type of
controlled experiment (or Randomised Control Trial) is rare in road safety infrastructure projects as it is
difficult to justify not treating a site that has been identified as high risk.

In recent years, the Empirical Bayes approach (for more details see Empirical Bayesian Methods in Section
10.3 Crash-based Identification (‘Reactive’ Approaches)) has emerged as an effective way of minimising
the impact of regression to the mean. Although the Empirical Bayes approach is recognised as good
practice in road safety evaluation, not all countries (especially those in LMICs) will have experience in
using this technique.

If not using this recommended approach, at the very least, a before-and-after analysis using comparison
sites should be undertaken, with at least three (but preferably five) years of data collected for the before
period. This is because the regression to the mean effect does tend to diminish if considered over longer
periods of time. For example, in a study conducted in two counties in the UK, Abbess et al. (1981)
calculated that regression to the mean had the following effects:

When a one-year period was used, the effect of regression to the mean was estimated to be
between 15-26%.
For two years, the estimate was 7-15%.
For three years, the estimate was 5-11%.

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 328/353



Where the Empirical Bayes approach has not been used, the above allowances could be made when
calculating the reduction in crashes produced by the countermeasures.

A method described by Abbess et al. (1981) is outlined in Appendix 12.1. The ‘regression-to-mean’
calculator is based on this method.

CALCULATOR: REGRESSION TO THE MEAN

CHANGES IN GENERAL CRASH TRENDS, INCLUDING TRAFFIC FLOW

When evaluating changes in crashes (or for most of the monitoring measures described in Observations),
other factors not affected by the treatment might still influence that measure, and therefore will have to
be taken into account. Examples include a change in the speed limit on roads that include the treated
crash site, national or local road safety campaigns, or traffic management schemes that might affect traffic
volume (e.g. closure of an intersection near the site, producing a marked change in traffic patterns).
Changes related to external factors may be compensated for by comparing the site under study, for the
same before and after periods, with comparison sites (or ‘control’ sites) that have not been treated. In
order for this data to be valid, it is important that these other sites experience exactly the same changes
as the site under evaluation.

Comparison data can be collected either by matched pairs or area controls. A matched pair control site
involves finding a site that is geographically close to the treated site (but not close enough to be affected
by any traffic diversion) and has similar general characteristics. This is so that the control site will be
subject to the same local variations that might affect safety (e.g. weather, traffic flows, safety campaigns,
etc.).

In practice it may be difficult to find other sites with similar safety problems that will be untreated purely
for the sake of statistical analysis. Area comparisons comprising a large number of sites are, therefore,
frequently used.

Comparison group sites should be as similar as possible to the treated sites, and they should not be
affected by the treatment.

CRASH MIGRATION

There is still some controversy over whether or not the ‘crash migration’ effect exists. It has been found
that crashes tend to increase at sites adjoining a successfully treated site, producing an apparent crash
transfer or ‘migration’. Why this effect occurs is unclear, but one hypothesis is that drivers are
‘compensating’ for the improved safety at treated sites by being less cautious elsewhere, especially those
who know the area well and are familiar with it.

Obviously, to detect such an occurrence, the crash frequencies in the surrounding area of the treated sites
before and after treatment need to be compared with a suitable comparison group. In other words, the
area of an evaluation study needs to be expanded to include routes that may be impacted by the project,
and comparison sites must be identified that have not been affected.

However, there are no established techniques yet available to estimate such an effect for a particular site.
The first reported occurrence of this feature (Boyle & W, 1984) found an overall crash increase in the
surrounding areas of about 9%, and a later study (Persaud, 1987) of a larger number of sites estimated the
increase to be 0.2 crashes per site per year.

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 329/353



A study by Austroads (2010) identified the effects that certain interventions have on the redistribution of
traffic, and suggest that this may be a cause of migration. If traffic is reduced at the treated location, it is
likely that it will be increased at a nearby location (this is likely in all situations, except the rare
circumstance where trip numbers are reduced). It is suggested that this redistribution is more likely for
certain types of treatments. For these interventions, evaluation of the effects should include a broader
geographic area to capture locations where exposure (and therefore risk) may be increased. Interventions
identified as potentially causing such an effect included:

Turn controls or bans.
Major changes to a route, such as parking changes.
Bridge closure.
Localised speed limit changes.
Intersection changes, e.g. signalisation, turn phase timing change, turning lanes.
Traffic calming.
Lane additions.
Addition of overtaking lanes.
Pedestrian treatments at intersections and at mid-block locations.
Railway crossing control.
Mid-block turning provision.

GRAPHICAL ANALYSIS

A simple visual method that has been used in some countries (e.g. Radin Umar et al., 1995) is to monitor
the trend in crashes over time. In this method, the cumulative crash numbers (and types) are plotted
together with their cumulative mean (see definitions below).

However, it should be noted that this is more useful for mass-action plans and not really suitable for single
sites (due to the lower numbers of crashes involved).

An example is shown in Figure 12.4, where the graph illustrates that a Malaysian motorcycle daytime
running headlight campaign was apparently effective in reducing collisions related to daytime conspicuity
(MSTOX = motorcycles moving straight or turning when other road users cross their path) while, as might
be expected, having no effect on nighttime crashes.

The table in Figure 12.4 shows the monthly cumulative frequency of related crashes in the second row,
which totals the actual number of crashes six months before and after the measure (end of June). The
cumulative mean (third row of the table) is obtained by simply calculating the average monthly crash
frequency over the before period (in this case 6 months) as the first month and then adding this figure
onto each subsequent month. This is the number of crashes that one would have expected, had the
measure not been taken. Lines 5 and 6 of this table show an equivalent number for night crashes. In this
case, the cumulative means are:

For MSTOX crashes: (68 + 48 + 79 + 44 + 61 + 73) / 6 = 62

For nighttime crashes: (17 + 16 + 28 + 11 + 15 + 20) / 6 = 18

It can be seen that during the after period (July to December), there is an increasing gap between the
observed number of daytime crashes (second row) and the expected number of crashes (third row). Since
the expected number is larger than the observed number, the measure is seen to have had a positive

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 330/353



effect. The (✽) sign in Figure 12.5 represents the effect of the measure. In comparison, the observed and
expected number of night crashes remain quite similar in the after period.

However, as already stated, to be sure that the random nature of collisions has been taken into account, a
much longer waiting period is normally required (usually three years) for a statistically valid result to be
available. For more immediate feedback, other behavioural data, as mentioned in the previous sections,
should be collected to give indications that a scheme is working as intended.

FIGURE 12.5: EXAMPLE - MOTORCYCLE CRASHES IN PILOT AREA OF ‘RUNNING HEADLIGHTS’ CAMPAIGN
(SOURCE: RADIN UMAR ET AL., 1995)

Where control sites (or similar untreated sites) have been selected, another simple exploratory method for
displaying the change in collisions at several treated sites has been described by Ogden (1996). For each
site in both the control and treated groups, collisions in the before period and after period (of the same
length) are plotted as shown in Figure 12.5 If there was no change in the number of crashes between the
two periods, then all the points would lie around a 45-degree line. The extent to which there is a change in
the after period is indicated by the departure from the 45° line.

If, as in Figure 12.6, the treated sites are trending markedly below the untreated sites, then it is suggested
that the treatment is having a positive effect.

ECONOMIC EVALUATION

As discussed in Chapter 11 Intervention Selection and Prioritisation, for every scheme the evaluation
should include an indication of the benefits actually achieved in relation to cost. Even if the scheme has
been designed to tackle a very specific target group of crashes, it is normal practice to include all collisions
at the site in a full evaluation – just in case the measure has had an unforeseen effect on other crash
types.

Appendix 12.1 describes how the collision impact of a specific road improvement can best be estimated.
Suppose that the estimated reduction was 68% (this is the result obtained in the example of Appendix
12.1 – k-test). If the site was one of the worst in the district, then we ought to make some allowance for
the regression-to-mean effect (e.g. Table 12.2). Let us assume this amounts to as much as 11%, such that
our best estimate of the true reduction in crashes is 57% (68% - 11%).

Since the original number of crashes in this example was 20, 11.4 crashes have been saved over the study
period (or 3.8 per year).

It should be noted that only injury crashes have been considered here but if there are a number of
damage-only occurring that are reliably reported, then these should also be included in the costing.
However, it must be stressed that in most countries of the world, damage-only crashes are frequently not
reported to the police and are thus a much more unreliable measure.

Based on an average injury-crash cost of $79,330 that has been used in the examples of the previous
chapter, this collision saving amounts to $301,454 per year. This figure is then compared to treatment
costs, i.e. $298,000. Assuming traffic delays due to the treatment are negligible, the First Year Rate of

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 332/353



Return (FYRR) equals:

FFYRR = 301,454/298,000 x 100 = 101.2%

The above FYRR figure should be rounded down to 101% to give an indication of the possible effect of
using this treatment in the future.

Other economic criteria that have been described in the previous chapter could also be used. For example,
the calculation of the Net Present Value (NPV) figures would be particularly advisable if, over future years,
there are known to be inevitable new maintenance costs associated with the installed measure.

It is only by evaluating and recording results in this way that a database of implemented remedial
measures and their effectiveness can be assimilated for use by road authorities throughout the country.

OVERALL EFFECTIVENESS AND FUTURE STRATEGY

This chapter has set out methods that can be used for evaluating the effects of particular schemes and
strategies. One way of publicising these results is for the road safety unit within a highway authority to
produce a regular strategy document that outlines its main road safety achievements as well as the
projected work.

A summary of this strategy document should be included in the official road safety action plan of a
country. This plan also includes, as background information, aggregate crash statistics by state, district, or
municipality, broken down into various categories, such as road user class, road class, etc. These
aggregate figures can be useful not only to indicate general priorities, but also to evaluate the effects of
wide-scale safety campaigns, as well as legislative and/or enforcement changes.

However, as schemes are usually localised, their effects are often difficult to detect among much larger
collision totals. Hence, the strategy document should probably include a summary listing of the
effectiveness of all low-cost schemes (e.g. Table 12.4). This is more informative than a single overall figure
as it displays the range of safety efforts taking place and the relative success of the various actions. The
official publication of past achievements and future plans has been found useful not only in making the
highway authority’s road safety team accountable, but also in helping the team focus its efforts on a long-
term casualty-reduction target. The document also provides valuable information to other workers, giving
real evidence of the extent to which schemes are successful.

12.5 PATHWAY TO EFFECTIVE MONITORING AND
EVALUATION

GETTING STARTED
Ensure key stakeholders understand the importance of monitoring, analysis and
evaluation. This should include an understanding of potential risks if these activities are
not undertaken.
Establish processes for the collection of relevant data at the start of any planned
activities. This collection could be undertaken as part of a corridor demonstration project.
Train key road agency staff and stakeholders in evaluation methods and data
management. This should include an understanding of robust methods used in analysis.
Track performance against road safety targets using these agreed methods.

MAKING PROGRESS
Increase awareness amongst key stakeholders about the importance of monitoring,
analysis and evaluation.
Collect relevant data, particularly on high-volume, high risk parts of the road network at
locations where interventions are made as the minimum. Extend this to all parts of the
road network including national, regional and local roads.
Adopt or develop tools to help in the monitoring and evaluation process.
Continue to build expertise amongst road agency staff and stakeholders on evaluation
methods.
Publish results so that others can access this information, and support for effective
interventions can be built.
Track performance against road safety targets, including through linkage between
intermediate and outcome measures. Use this knowledge to improve processes including
the types of interventions selected.

CONSOLIDATING ACTIVITY
Continue to increase awareness amongst key stakeholders about the importance of
monitoring and evaluation.
Collect relevant monitoring data on all parts of the road network, including at locations
beyond where interventions were made to provide the necessary data to facilitate
appropriate before-after evaluations of interventions.
Internationally benchmark tools and approaches to help in the monitoring and evaluation
process.
Continue to build expertise amongst road agency staff and stakeholders on evaluation
methods.
Continue to track performance against road safety targets, including through linkage
between intermediate and outcome measures. Inform stakeholders about progress
against targets, including information on effective road safety treatments. This
information should be directed to internal stakeholders, politicians, external stakeholders,

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 335/353



and members of the public.
Internationally benchmark this performance against the worlds’ best road safety nations
and use this knowledge to help improve processes.

APPENDIX 12.1 – STATISTICAL TESTS
STUDENT T-TEST – COMPARISON OF SAMPLE MEANS
To determine whether the mean speed of a set of speed measurements is significantly different from
another (i.e. between a before and after study), it is appropriate to use Student two-tailed t-test, making
the reasonable assumptions that the variances of the two sets of measurements are drawn from the same
population. The null hypothesis is thus that there is no difference in the means (i.e. that drivers’ speed has
not been affected by the scheme). It is first necessary to determine the standard deviation of the
difference in means. We then calculate the equations below:

Having calculated the value of t, we need to look at a table of Student t values (Table 12.A1) with (na + nb
– 2) degrees of freedom (ʋ). If the calculated value of t exceeds that for the 5% level (the t = 0.05 column),
we can be 95% confident that the true mean speed has changed.

Example

Assume that the following results were obtained from spot speed studies:

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 339/353



From equation [EQ. 12.1]:

As the calculated t value (9.69) is greater than 1.96 (large number of degrees of freedom), we can
say that the difference in mean speeds (a 4 km/h reduction) is significant at the 5% level.

This test can be conducted with the CALCULATOR: DISTRIBUTION TEST

TABLE 12.A1: TABLE OF T-DISTRIBUTION

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 340/353



KOLMOGOROV-SMIRNOV TEST
The ‘two-tailed’ test determines whether two independent samples have been drawn from the same
population (or from populations with the same distribution). In some cases, two data sets may have the
same mean but different dispersion, which may be the cause of safety problems. If the two samples have
in fact been drawn from the same population (the null hypothesis), then the cumulative distributions of
both samples may be expected to be fairly close to each other, i.e. they should show only random
deviation from the population distributions. If the two sample cumulative distributions are too far apart at
any point, this suggests that they come from different populations. Thus, a large enough deviation
between the two sample cumulative distributions is evidence for rejecting the null hypothesis.

Let SNa(x) be the observed cumulative step function of the first speed sample: i.e. SNa(x) = K/Na where K is
the number of vehicles equal to or less than x km/h and Na is the total number of vehicles of the sample.

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 341/353



Let SNb(x) be the cumulative step function of the second sample. Now the Kolmogorov-Smirnov two-tail test
focuses on the maximum deviation, D.

For large samples (N > 40), Kolmogorov-Smirnov tables show that the value of D must equal or exceed the
following value to reject the null hypothesis at the 5% level, i.e. they are not from the same population:

The ‘one-tailed’ test determines whether the two samples have been drawn from the same population or
whether the values of one sample are stochastically larger than the values of the population from which
the other sample was drawn. The maximum deviation is again calculated using [EQ. 12.2] and the
significance of the observed value of D can be computed by reference to the chi-square distribution.

It has been shown that for large samples, the following statistic has a sampling distribution that is
approximated to the chi-square distribution with two degrees of freedom. The chi-square table is given in
Table 12.A2.

CALCULATOR: DISTRIBUTION TEST

TABLE 12.A2: TABLE OF X2

K TEST
The k test can be used to show how the crash numbers at a site have changed compared to control data.

For a given site or group of similarly treated sites, we have:

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 343/353



where:

a = before crashes at site
b = after crashes at site
c = before crashes at control
d = after crashes at control

If k < 1 then there has been a decrease in crashes relative to the control.

if k = 1 then there has been no change relative to the control.

if k > 1 then there has been an increase relative to the control.

If any of the frequencies are zero, then ½ should be added to each, i.e.:

The percentage change at the site is given by:

Example
Table 12.A3 shows the annual injury crash totals for a T-intersection in a semi-urban area
that had stop signs on the minor road originally, but where a roundabout was installed three
years ago. The control data used are crashes on all other priority intersections in the district
over exactly the same 3-year before and 3-year after periods.
TABLE 12.A3: INJURY CRASH FREQUENCIES AT TREATED SITE AND CONTROLS

 SITE CONTROL TOTAL
BEFORE 20 (a) 418 (c) 438 (g)
AFTER 6 (b) 388 (d) 394 (h)
TOTAL 26 (e) 806 (f) 832 (n)

Using the notation and equation above:
Therefore, as k < 1, there has been a decrease in crashes relative o the controls of:
(k-1) x 100% = 68%
This test can be conducted with the CALCULATOR: BEFORE – AFTER TESTS (INDIVIDUAL
SITE).

THE CHI-SQUARE TEST
This test can be used to determine whether the change in crashes was produced by the treatment or
occurred by chance. The test thus determines whether the change is statistically significant. It is based on
a contingency table showing both the observed values of a set of data (O) and the corresponding expected
values (E). The chi-square statistic is given by:

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 344/353



Where:

Oij = the observed value in column j, row i of the table
Eij = the expected value in column j, row i of the table
m = the number of columns
n = the number of rows

A chi-square table is then used to look up this value, which shows the probability that the ‘expected’ value
and the ‘observed’ values are drawn from the same population. The number of degrees of freedom is also
required and this is given by:

Degrees of freedom (ʋ) = (n – 1) (m – 1)

For a site crash evaluation, where its crashes are compared in similar periods before and after treatment
with a set of control sites for the same periods, we have a 2 by 2 contingency table (2 columns and 2 rows
with degrees of freedom = 1). For the test to be valid, the value of any cell of the table should not be less
than 5.

Using notation from Table 12.A3, the chi-square value can be calculated by the following equation:

This value is then compared with the chi-square values in Table 12.A2 with degrees of freedom, ʋ = 1, and
if it is greater than a particular value, it is said to be statistically significant at least at that percentage
level.

Example
Using the data in the previous example and the [EQ. 12.9], we obtain:

Now looking at the chi-square distribution table (Table 12.A2) and the first line (one degree
of freedom, ʋ =1), the value for chi-square of 5.38 lies between 3.84 and 5.41. This
corresponds to a value of significance level (on the column header line) of between 0.05
and 0.02.
This means that there is only a 5% likelihood (or 1 in 20 chance) that the change in crashes
is due to random fluctuation. Another way of stating this is that there is a 97,9% confidence
that a real change in crashes has occurred at the intersection. The 5% level or better is
widely accepted as indicating the remedial action has certainly worked, though the 10%
level can be regarded as indicating an effect.
CALCULATOR: BEFORE – AFTER TESTS (INDIVIDUAL SITE)

GROUP OF SITES WITH THE SAME TREATMENT
For a number of sites, N, which have had the same treatment, determining the overall effect requires a

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 345/353



rather more complex calculation, i.e. by solving the following equation for k over all the sites, i.e. i = 1 to
N. The other symbols are as in previous equations.

For testing, the natural logarithm of a variable such as is usually found to have a more symmetrical
distribution (amenable to standard statistical treatments) and the standard error of loge k can be
approximated to the following:

The following ratio should then be calculated using loge of the value of k calculated above and its standard
error from the previous expression:

And if this value is outside the range ±1.96 (Student t), then the change is statistically significant (at the
95% level).

Now to test whether the changes at the treated sites are in fact producing the same effect on crash
frequencies, we need to calculate the following chi-square value.

If this is significant with N-1 degrees of freedom (refer to the (N-1)th row in the chi-square table, where N is
the number of treated sites), then the changes at the sites are not producing the same effect. If it is not
significant, however, then it is likely that the changes are producing the same effect.

CALCULATOR: BEFORE – AFTER TEST (GROUP OF SITES)

REGRESSION TO THE MEAN CORRECTION
To correct for the regression-to-mean effect, the safety level (or long-term average crash frequency) must
be estimated. Several statisticians have proposed ways of doing this. For example, Hauer (1992)
recommended using Empirical Bayesian method to estimate the level of safety of a site and then use this
value in safety studies (rather than the raw data). However, Abbess et al. (1981) previously described a
simpler approach for a single site, in which the data was adjusted to correct for biases using assumptions
about the distribution of crashes over a period of years.

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 346/353



Crashes data must be gathered for sites that are similar to the treated site over the same time period.
Using this full dataset, the mean number of crashes, a, and the variance of crashes, m var (a), are
calculated. The regression-to-mean effect, R (in %), is given by the following equation:

where:

A = number of crashes at the site
n = number of years

At and nt are the estimates of the parameters of the statistical distribution showing the true underlying
crash frequencies, i.e. the crash frequency’s probability distribution before any data is available. The main
assumption is, therefore, that the study site with a particular crash history will behave in the same way as
the set of all similar sites with the same crash history.

Example
Let us consider an intersection that has had an average of 15 crashes per year over the
past 5 years. The site was widened, large new intersection signing, splitter islands and STOP
signs were installed, after which the site has averaged 10 crashes per year over a similar
period.
To correct for the regression-to-mean effect, we need to select similar uncontrolled
intersection sites with similar traffic flows. If all these sites have produced a mean, a, of
12.6 crashes per year with a variance, var (a), of 2.91, the input values are:
a = 12.6 crash/year
var(a) = 2.91 (crash/year)2
A = 75 crash/5 years
n = 5 years
At = 12.62 / (2.91 – 12.6) = –16.38
nt = 12.6 / (2.91 – 12.6) = –1.3

Thus, the regression effect:
In other words, during the after period we would expect that if nothing were done to the
site, the crashes would drop by 5.6%, or to 14.16 crashes per year. Thus, it is the figure of
14.16 crashes per year that should be compared with the 10 crashes per year that actually
occurred to determine whether the reduction in crash frequency due to the improvements
is statistically significant.

TECHNICAL SHEETS
This section details the relationship between safety and a variety of road components (horizontal and
vertical alignment, road surface, etc.). The principle human capabilities and limitations that analysts must
consider in order to gain a clear understanding of the origin of the problems they are facing and to
facilitate the choice of appropriate solutions are discussed in greater detail in Chapter 8 of this manual.

TECHNICAL SHEET - HORIZONTAL ALIGNMENT

The main goal in designing horizontal road alignments is to ensure consistency and uniformity along the
road corridor. This approach enhances safety by providing predictability, so drivers can anticipate
upcoming road conditions. The ‘no surprises’ philosophy aims to give drivers clear visual cues, such as a
good view of an approaching curve, allowing them ample time to adjust their speed accordingly

This technical sheet describes the key characteristics of horizontal curves that need to be considered in a
safety analysis:

Curve radius (or degree of curve)
Speed differentials.
Surface condition.
Superelevation.
Road width.
Shoulders.
Roadsides – sight distance.
Roadsides – forgiving road
Passing.
Warning signs and devices.
Combination of features.

TECHNICAL SHEET - INTERSECTIONS

Intersections are an essential part of a road network where two or more roads or streets meet or cross:
drivers can change their path in them, thus enabling a large number of destinations to be reached with a
minimum number of roads.

Intersections are the locations on the network where most crashes occur:

Conflicts between vehicles and/or vulnerable users are much more likely.
Human errors are also more likely since users must choose among several paths, adjust their
speed and carry out their manoeuvres under high time and space constraints.

This technical sheet doesn’t cover interchanges, while the following conventional types of intersections are
presented:

Uncontrolled and unsignalised (priority) intersections.
Signalised intersections.
Roundabouts.

©World Road Association (PIARC) / Association mondiale de la Route (AIPCR) - 01/06/2025 350/353



Acceleration and deceleration lanes are also presented in this technical sheet.

TECHNICAL SHEET - ROAD SURFACE CONDITION

This technical sheet describes the relationship between safety and two characteristics of the road surface -
friction and roughness. There is a strong relationship that has been established between friction and
safety.

TECHNICAL SHEET - SIGHT DISTANCE

In a safety study, analysts must determine the available sight distances and compare them with the
required sight distances.

Available sight distances are measured at the site. At the design stage, available sight distances may be
calculated using graphic or mathematical methods. For existing roads, however, field measurements are
recommended as they may reveal sight obstructions that are not shown on plans. These distances may
vary significantly according to the selected driver eye height and the height of the object to be perceived.
The Sight distance - Technical Study describes how to measure available sight distances; it also indicates
the object and eye heights that are recommended in several countries.

This technical sheet describes the underlying principles for determining the required sight distances under
various criteria.

TECHNICAL SHEET - VERTICAL ALIGNMENT

The main elements to consider when conducting a safety analysis at a grade are:

On downhill grades: increases in braking distances and possibility of heavy vehicle brake overheating.

On uphill grades: speed differentials between passenger cars and heavy vehicles.

On crest curves: restricted sight distances.

On sag curves: water accumulation and accelerated erosion of shoulders due to water run-off.

This technical sheet describes these various problems and how to address them.

TECHNICAL STUDIES
This section explains how to conduct various technical studies that are often required during safety
analyses (spot speed studies, traffic counts, etc.). Simple procedures are described and their
implementation is illustrated by means of practical examples.

TECHNICAL STUDY - FRICTION

This technical study outlines the main observations that need to be made at a site to verify if road surface
friction is adequate and determine the need for instrumented tests. However, it does not describe in their
details the numerous testing methods and equipment that have been developed over the years to identify
and quantify road surface deficiencies

Some further insights on this topic can be found in the Technical Sheet - Road Surface Condition

TECHNICAL STUDY - SIGHT DISTANCE

Various sight distance criteria must be met, depending on the type of site under study: stopping,
manoeuvring, passing sight distances, etc. These criteria are described in the Technical Sheet - Sight
Distance. This engineering study describes how to measure available sight distances.

TECHNICAL STUDY - SPOT SPEED

In a spot speed study, a sample of speeds are collected at a specific road location in order to determine
the speed distribution of vehicles and to calculate some statistics that are used to make engineering
decisions. This Technical Study describes various methods of undertaking such studies for varying degrees
of automation.

TECHNICAL STUDY - TRAFFIC CONFLICTS

In most road safety studies, analysts use the information contained on crash reports to identify and
understand failures of the road system and then propose appropriate corrective actions.

While these analyses are essential, it is well recognized that crash data suffer from a number of
shortcomings and need to be complemented by field observations in order to improve the accuracy of
safety diagnoses.

This Technical Study describes how and when to undertake such studies.

TECHNICAL STUDY - TRAFFIC COUNT

Counts of the number of vehicles passing at a site are often required in road safety analyses, in order to
determine if road safety problems may be related to traffic flow deficiencies.

This Technical Study outlines some of the main aspects related to traffic counts that needs to be
considered in road safety studies.

TECHNICAL STUDY - TRAVEL TIME AND DELAY

This Technical Study describes how to measure the travel time between two points on a road and the
stopped time delays at an intersection. Both measurements are aimed at determining if road users are
facing excessive delays. In addition to impeding traffic flow, delays may have an adverse impact on road
safety as they increase frustration, leading to hazardous behaviour: choice of unsafe traffic gaps, failure to
stop at red lights, hazardous passing manoeuvres, etc.

Delays can be estimated from field observations or, more theoretically, with equations or simulation
programs. This engineering study describes two simple field observation methods.
